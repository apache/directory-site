# 4.2 - Authorization
ApacheDS uses an adaptation of the X.500 basic access control scheme in
combination with X.500 subentries to control access to entries and
attributes within the DIT. This document will show you how to enable the
basic access control mechanism and how to define access control information
to manage access to protected resources.

## Some Simple Examples

The ACIItem syntax is very expressive and that makes it extremely powerful
for specifying complex access control policies. However the syntax is not
very easy to grasp for beginners. For this reason we start with simple
examples that focus on different protection mechanisms offered by the
ACIItem syntax. We do this instead of specifying the grammar which is not
the best way to learn a language.

<DIV class="warning" markdown="1">
<B>Before you go any further...</B>
Please don't go any further until you have read up on the use of
Subentries. Knowledge of subentries, subtreeSpecifications, administrative
areas, and administrative roles are required to properly digest the
following material.
</DIV>

Before going on to these trails you might want to set up an Administrative
Area for managing access control via prescriptiveACI.  Both subentryACI and
prescriptiveACI require the presence of an Administrative Point entry.	For
more information and code examples see [ACAreas](acareas.html). 

### ACI Trails

Here are some trails that resemble simple HOWTO guides.  They're ordered
with the most pragmatic usage first.  We will add to these trails over
time.

| Trail | Description |
|---|---|
| DenySubentryAccess (TBW) | Protecting access to subentries themselves. || Enabling access to browse and read all entries and their attributes by authenticated users. |
| [Allow Self Password Modify](4.2.7.2-allow-self-password-modify.html) | Granting users the rights needed to change their own passwords. |
| GrantAddDelModToGroup (TBW) | Granting add, delete, and modify permissions to a group of users. |
| GrantModToEntry (TBW) | Applying ACI to a single entry. |
| [Enable Authenticated Users to Browse and Read Entries](4.2.7.1-enable-authenticated-users-to-browse-and-read-entries.html)
