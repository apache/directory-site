# 4.2.7.2 - Allow Self Password Modify

We will  now configure the system to allow anyone to modify his/her own password :

    
    {
      identificationTag "allowSelfAccessAndModification",
      precedence 14,
      authenticationLevel none,
      itemOrUserFirst userFirst: 
      {
        userClasses { thisEntry },
        userPermissions 
        { 
          { protectedItems {entry}, grantsAndDenials { grantModify, grantBrowse, grantRead } },
          { protectedItems {allAttributeValues {userPassword}}, grantsAndDenials { grantAdd, grantRemove } }
        } 
      } 
    }

## Commentary

Note that two different user permissions are used to accurately specify self access and self modification of the **userPassword** attribute within the entry.  So with the first userPermission of this ACI a user would be able to read all attributes and values within his/her entry.  They also have the ability to modify the entry but this is moot since they cannot add, remove or replace any attributes within their entry.  The second user permission completes the picture by granting add and remove permissions to all values of userPassword.  This means the user can replace the password.

<DIV class="warning" markdown="1">
**grantAdd + grantRemove = grantReplace**
Modify operations either add, remove or replace attributes and their values in LDAP.  X.500 seems to have overlooked the replace capability.  Hence there is no such thing as a *grantReplace* permission.  However grantAdd and grantDelete on an attribute and its values are both required for a replace operation to take place.
