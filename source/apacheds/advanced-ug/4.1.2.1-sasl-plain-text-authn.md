# 4.1.2.1 SASL PLAIN Authentication

The **SASL PLAIN** authentication is most certainly useless, as one can already authenticate using the **Simple Bind**. However, it's still possible to issue a **SASL PLAIN** authentication on _ApacheDS_.

The difference with a **Simple Bind** is that the user's name is not  **DN**, but a meaningful value that is stored into one of the user's entry Attributes.

When the server receives a **SASL PLAIN** bind request, it will look for the first entry which **uid** is equal to the provided value, starting from the server **searchBaseDN** position in the DIT.

<DIV class="note" markdown="1">
ApacheDS expect the given name to be stored in the **UID** Attribute. This is not configurable in this version of the server.

ApacheDS does not yet support the authorization identity parameter.
