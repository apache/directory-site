# 1.4 - Interceptors

_Interceptors_ are functional layers inside the _DirectoryService_. Each one of them are responsible for a specific task. They are ordered, and this order is not to be changed.

Each operation received by the _DirectoryService_ will be processed by various interceptors, one after the other, down to the backend, and again when the result comes back to the caller. An _interceptor_ can call the next _interceptor_, whcih will be determinated by the position it has in the chain of _interceptors_, or simply return. Note that calling the next _interceptor_ does not require that you know which one will be called.

Some _Interceptors_ can be disabled, some other can be enabled. It's also possible to add some new one.

All in all, they will handle operations from a specific functional aspect.

## Handled operations

Each _Interceptor_ handles a subset of the possible operations, among those listed in the following table :

| Operation | Description |
|---|---|
| add | Adds an entry in the backend |
| bind | Binds on the DirectoryService |
| compare | Compares the elements with the associated entry in the backend |
| delete | Deletes the entry |
| getRooDSE | Gets back the RootDSE entry |
| hasEntry | Tells if an entry exists |
| lookup | Fetches an entry |
| modify | Modifies an entry |
| move | Moves an entry |
| moveAndRename | Moves and renames an entry |
| rename | Renames an entry |
| search | Searches for entries |
| unbind | Unbinds from the DirectoryService |

It is important to understand that each operation will go through each _Interceptor_ declared to handle the operation, down to the backend.

## Existing interceptors

The following interceptors are already present in the server, even if they are not enabled.
In this table, we list all the operations each interceptor is handling, and if the _interceptor_ is enabled by default or not :

| Interceptor | Enabled |add|bnd|cmp|del|DSE|has|lkp|mod|mov|m&r|ren|sea|ubd|

| TriggerInterceptor | yes | X | - | - | X | - | - | - | X | X | X | X | - | - |

The operations that are available are the operations for which we have some implementation in the interceptor class. For instance, the _JournalInterceptor_ class implement the _add_, _delete_, _modify_, _move_, _moveAndRename_ and _rename_ methods.

## Interceptors order

As we already said, the _Interceptors_ order is significant : why would we proceed an _Add_ operation through all the _Interceptors_ if the user is simply denied the right to add an entry by the _AciAuthorizationInterceptor_ ?

Currently, the following order is enforced :

| Order | Interceptor |
|---|---|
| 1 | NormalizationInterceptor |
| 2 | AuthenticationInterceptor |
| 3 | ReferralInterceptor |
| 4 | AciAuthorizationInterceptor |
| 5 | DefaultAuthorizationInterceptor |
| 6 | AdministrativePointInterceptor |
| 7 | ExceptionInterceptor |
| 8 | SchemaInterceptor |
| 9 | OperationalAttributeInterceptor |
| 10 | SubentryInterceptor |
| 11 | EventInterceptor |
| 12 | TriggerInterceptor |
| 13 | ChangeLogInterceptor |
| 14 | JournalInterceptor |

## Example

Let's consider the _search_ operation. It will be processed successively by the following _Interceptors_, as it can be deduced by the two previous tables :

* NormalizationInterceptor
* AuthenticationInterceptor
* AciAuthorizationInterceptor
* DefaultAuthorizationInterceptor
* SchemaInterceptor
* OperationalAttributeInterceptor
* SubentryInterceptor


We can do the same exercise for each operation.

## Processing

Basically, an _Interceptor_ receives a request for an operation, does some pre-processing, calls the next _Interceptor_ in the chain, does some post-processing, and returns a result.

Calling the next _Interceptor_ is as simple as calling the _next(OperationContext)_ method, which will compute the right _Interceptor_.

The pre-processing and post-processing are standard Java code, there is nothing special there. 

Each operation is passed into an instance of a specific _OperationContext_, which contains all what is needed about the operation and the environment.
