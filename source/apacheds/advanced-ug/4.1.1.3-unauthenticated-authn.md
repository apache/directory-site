# 4.1.1.3 - Unauthenticated Authentication

The **Unauthenticated Authentication** mechanism is a bit specific. First of all, none all the **LDAP** servers support such a mechanism. In fact, the default behavior is for server to return a **unwillingToPerform** result code when someone tries to bind using a null password.

We won't go any deeper into this 'feature', those interested in the rational behind it and the associated drawbacks can read the following links :

  [RFC 4513, Unauthenticated Authentication Mechanism of Simple Bind](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4513#section-5.1.2)
and
  [RFC 4513, Unauthenticated Mechanism Security Considerations](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4513#section-6.3.1)
