# 4.2.4.3 - SubentryACI

Access to subentries also needs to be controlled. Subentries are special in
ApacheDS. Although they subordinate to an administrative entry (entry of an
Administrative Point), they are technically considered to be in the same
context as their administrative entry. ApacheDS considers the perscriptive
ACI applied to the administrative entry, to also apply to its subentries. 

This however is not the most intuitive mechanism to use for explicitly
controlling access to subentries. A more explicit mechanism is used to
specify ACIs specifically for protecting subentries. ApacheDS uses the
multivalued operational attribute, *subentryACI*, within administrative
entries to control access to immediately subordinate subentries.

Protection policies for ACIs themselves can be managed within the entry of
an administrative point.
