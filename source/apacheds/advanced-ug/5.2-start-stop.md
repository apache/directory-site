# 5.2 - Starting and Stopping the server

{{% toc %}}

## 5.2.1 Archive Distribution (zip/tar.gz)

### Starting ApacheDS

#### On Linux/Unix Systems

In a terminal, first move to the ApacheDS directory of the unarchived distribution and then run the _**apacheds.sh**_ script in the _**bin**_ directory:

    $ cd <path-to-apacheds-directory>
    $ sh bin/apache.sh

#### On Windows

Double-click the _**apacheds.bat**_ command in the _**bin**_ directory or in a terminal, first move to the _**bin**_ directory of the unarchived distribution and then run the _**apacheds.bat**_ command:

    $ cd <path-to-apacheds-directory>\bin
    $ apacheds.bat

### Stopping ApacheDS

ApacheDS can be stopped by hitting _**CTL+C**_ in the terminal the server was launched with. If the _**apacheds.bat**_ command was double-clicked, closing the terminal window will also stop ApacheDS. 

## 5.2.2 Windows Installer (.exe)

ApacheDS is registered as a service on Windows. Start and Stop operations can be achieved in the _**Services**_ utility which is accessible via _**Start**_ > _**Control Panel**_ > _**Administration Tools**_ > _**Services**_.

ApacheDS also provides an easier access to the _**Services**_ utility via _**Start**_ > _**All Programs**_ > _**ApacheDS**_ > _**Manage ApacheDS**_. 

### Starting ApacheDS

The ApacheDS service can be started right-clicking on the _**ApacheDS - Default**_ service and selecting _**Start**_ in the context menu.

### Stopping ApacheDS

The ApacheDS service can be started right-clicking on the _**ApacheDS - Default**_ service and selecting _**Stop**_ in the context menu.
