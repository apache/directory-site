# 3.1. Administrative points

An *Administrative Point* is an entry which is defining a starting point
from which some of the four existing administrative roles will span. It's
important to understand than an Administrative Point (or *AP*) comes hand
in hand with the associated *Subentries*, otherwise it's useless.

Any entry can be defined as an *AP*.

In the following schema, we have depicted a DIT with three *AP*s, the big
one being an *AAP*, the blue one is a *SAP* and the green one is an *IAP*.
They all define an area on which they are active and the dashed lines for
the *IAP* are used to express the fact that an entry within the *IAP* area
still depends on the higher *AAP*.

Directly under an *AP*, we will find some *Subentries* defining the scopes
on which they are active. These scopes (one per subentry) are called
*SubtreeSpecification*, and define the entries that can be handled by the
role the Subentry is defined for.

The schema shows the relation between the *AP* and one *SubEntry* :

## Administrative Point
We will describe the types of Administrative Points we are managing and the
way they impact their associated Administrative Areas (*AA*)

We have three different kind of *AP*  :

* Autonomous AP ( *AAP*)
* Specific AP (*SAP*)
* Inner AP (*IAP*)

Those three different *APs* are related with each other in this way :

* *AAPs* manage an *AA* as if all the possible type of *SAP* where declared
for this area
* *SAPs* manage an *AA* with respect to one specific kind of role (Access
Control, Collective Attributes, SubSchema or Trigger Execution)
* IAPs manage an *AA* inside another *AP*
* An *AAP* or a *SAP* starts at some point in the tree, and all the entries
below this *AAP*/*SAP* aren't related to any other *AAP*. That also means
that if an *AAP*/*SAP* is created below an existing AP, then all the
entries it covers are unlinked from the previous AP (except that for *SAP*,
we just logically keep a link to the higher AP for all the other aspects
but the one covered by the new *SAP*)
* An *IAP* _must_ be included into another *AP*, being it an *AAP*, *SAP*
or *IAP*. It controls a specific aspect too, as for the *SAP*, but it will
be combined with any of the above *AP*.

## Roles
*AP* are managing some administrative aspect, defined by a role :

* ACI : Manage the access control
* CollectiveAttribute : Manage the collective attributes
* SubSchema (not handled atm) 
* TriggrExecution : Manage the execution of stored procedures

# Subentry

Once we have defined an *AP*, we can add some *subentries* which contain
the description of the administrative actions, including :

* The area this *subentry* covers, defined by a *SubtreeSpecification*,
named *subtree*.


The *SubtreeSpecification* can be complex. Its grammar is given below :


    <subtreeSpecification> ::= '{' <sps-e> <subtreeSpecificationComponent-e>'}'
    
    <subtreeSpecificationComponent-e> ::= <subtreeSpecificationComponent> <sps-e>    <subtreeSpecificationComponent-list> | e
    
    <subtreeSpecificationComponent-list> ::= ',' <sps-e>
    <subtreeSpecificationComponent> <sps-e>
    <subtreeSpecificationComponent-list> | e 
    
    <subtreeSpecificationComponent> ::= 
        'base' <sps> DN
        | 'specificExclusions' <sps> '{' <sps-e> <specificExclusion-e> '}'
        | 'minimum' <sps> INTEGER
        | 'maximum' <sps> INTEGER
        | 'specificationFilter' <sps> <refinement-filter>
    
    <specificExclusion-e> ::= <specificExclusion> <sps-e>
    <specificExclusion-list> | e
    
    <specificExclusion-list> ::= ',' <sps-e> <specificExclusion> <sps-e>
    <specificExclusion-list> | e
    
    <specificExclusion> ::= 'chopBefore' <sps-e> ':' <sps-e> DN | 'chopAfter'
    <sps-e> ':' <sps-e> DN
    
    <refinement-filter> ::= <refinement> | FILTER
    
    <refinement> ::= 
        'item' <sps-e> ':' <sps-e> <oid> 
        | 'and' <sps-e> ':' <sps-e> '{' <sps-e> <refinement-e> '}'
        | 'or' <sps-e> ':' <sps-e> '{' <sps-e> <refinement-e> '}' 
        | 'not' <sps-e> ':' <sps-e> <refinement>
    
    <refinement-e> ::= <refinement> <sps-e> <refinement-list> | e
    
    <refinement-list> ::= ',' <sps-e> <refinement> <sps-e> <refinement-list> | e
    
    <oid> ::= DESCR | NUMERICOID
    
    <sps> ::= ' ' <sps-e>
    
    <sps-e> ::= ' ' <sps-e> | e


Some exemple of such subtrees :

**select all the entries below the AdministrativePoint entry :**

    {} 
 

**select all the entries below the ou=users branch
starting from the AdministrativePoint entry :**

    { base "ou=users" } 


** exclude all the entries below the "ou=groups" branch : **

    { specificExclusions { chopBefore:"ou=groups" } }
