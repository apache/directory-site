# 4.1.1 - Simple Authentication

This authentication mode uses a **Simple Bind Request**. It's just about sending a name and a password to the server, which will either create a session for the given credentials, or reject the request.

As we said, we have to pass a name and a password. This leads to three different combinations of **Simple Bind** :

  * [4.1.1.1 - Anonymous Authentication](4.1.1.1-anonymous-authn.html)
  * [4.1.1.2 - Name/Password Authentication](4.1.1.2-name-password-authn.html)
  * [4.1.1.3 - Unauthenticated Authentication](4.1.1.3-unauthenticated-authn.html)

 The second mechanism is a normal authentication. Not all the servers support the 2 following mechanisms.
