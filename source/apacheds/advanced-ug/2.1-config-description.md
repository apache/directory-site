# 2.1 - Configuration Description

It's a good practice to not modify the configuration LDIF file by hand, instead use the Studio Configuration plugin to modify the server configuration.

# Overall structure

The configuration is stored in a hierarchical order, where sub-elements are related to their parent. For instance, the _Transports_ are associated to the corresponding _Server_ that uses them. Each server may contain one or more transports.

The following hierarchy describe the different kind of elements that one can configure, and their relationship :

* ou=config
	* [ads-directoryServiceId=XXXXX (Directory Service)](#directory-service) 
		* [ads-changeLogId=XXXXX (ChangeLog)](#change-log)
		* [ads-journalId=XXXXX (Journal)](#journal)
		* [ou=interceptors (Interceptors)](#interceptors)
			* [ads-interceptorId=authenticationInterceptor (Authentication Interceptor)](#authentication-Interceptor)
				* [ou=authenticators (Authenticators)](#authenticators)
				* [ou=passwordPolicies (Password Policies)](#password-policies)
		* [ou=partitions (Partitions)](#partitions)
			* [ads-partitionId=system (JDBM Partition)](#jdbm-partition)
				* [ou=indexes (Indexes)](#indexes)
					* [ads-indexAttributeId=XXXXX (Indexed Attribute)](#indexed-attribute)
		* [ou=servers (Servers)](#servers)
			* [ads-serverId=ldapServer (Ldap Server)](#ldap-server)
    			* [ou=transports (Transports)](#transports)
    			* [ou=replConsumers (ReplConsumers)](#repl-consumers)
    			* [ou=extendedOpHandlers (Extended Operation Handlers)](#extended-op-handlers)
    			* [ou=saslMechHandlers (SASL Mechanisms)](#sasl-mechanisms)
			* [ads-serverId=kerberosServer (Kerberos Server)](#kerberos-server)
    			* [ou=transports (Transports)](#transports)
			* [ads-serverId=httpServer (Http Server)](#http-server)
    			* [ou=transports (Transports)](#transports)
    			* [ou=httpWebApps (HttpWebApps)](#http-web-apps)
			* [ads-serverId=changePasswordServer (ChangePassword Server)](#change-password-server)
    			* [ou=transports (Transports)](#transports)

Note that in order to modify one element, you have to go down the tree up to the entry containing the elements you want to modify. For instance, to modify the TCP port for LDAP server, you have to modify the following entry :

    **ads-transportid=ldap, ou=transports, ads-serverId=ldapServer, ou=servers, ads-directoryServiceId=XXXXX, ou=config**

We will now explain each one of those elements.

Note that bold attributes are mandatory in the following tables.
</DIV>

# Directory Service

This is the heart of the entire system : the place where we store the data. Most of the servers are depending on this component. You may have more than one server(e.g LDAP, Kerberos, ChangePassword etc), but only one _DirectoryService_. 

Configuration options:

| AttributeType | type | default value | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| **ads-directoryServiceId** | _String_ |  | The unique identifier for the service |
| ads-enabled | _boolean_  | true | Tells if the DirectoryService is enabled |
| description | _String_  | N/A | A short optional description |
| **ads-dsReplicaId** | _int_ | 1 | The replication identifier |
| **ads-dsAccessControlEnabled** | _boolean_  | true | Tells if the Access Control interceptor is active |
| **ads-dsAllowAnonymousAccess** | _boolean_  | false | Tells if the service allow anonymous access |
| **ads-dsDenormalizeOpAttrsEnabled** | _boolean_  | true | Tells if the service should denormalize operational attributes |
| **ads-dsPasswordHidden** | _boolean_  | true | Tells if the passwords should be encrypted (not used) |
| **ads-dsSyncPeriodMillis** | _long_  | 15000 | The delay in milliseconds before we flush data on disk |
| ads-dsTestEntries | _String_  | N/A | Not used |


## Change Log

The _ChangeLog_ is an optional system that logs every change made on the server, and also records the revert operation, allowing the system to rollback the changes if needed. This is extremely useful when running tests.

Note that at the moment, changelog has in-memory support only.

It's disabled by default.

Configuration options:

| AttributeType | type | default value | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| **ads-changeLogId** | _String_ |  | The unique identifier for the system |
| ads-enabled | _boolean_  | false | Tells if the ChangeLog system is enabled |
| description | _String_  | N/A | A short optional description |
| **ads-changeLogExposed** | _boolean_  | false | Tells if the ChangeLog is exposed to the users |

## Journal

The _Journal_ logs every modification on the file system. It's intended to be used if the _DirectoryService_ crashes, as we can re-apply the journal starting from a date in the past where we know that the underlying database is correct.

Configuration options:

| AttributeType | type | default value | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| **ads-journalId** | _String_ | N/A | The unique identifier for the Journal |
| ads-enabled | _boolean_  | false | Tells if the Journal system is enabled |
| description | _String_  | N/A | A short optional description |
| **ads-journalWorkingDir** | _String_ | N/A | The working directory the Journal will be stored in |
| **ads-journalRotation** | _String_ | N/A | The number of operation stored befoe the journal is rotated |
| **ads-journalFileName** | _String_ | journal.txt | The file contaning the Journal |

## Interceptors

The default _Interceptors_ are generally not configurable. You don't want to change their order, or remove anyone from the default interceptors unless you are very familiar with the
internals of ApacheDS and/or including a custom interceptor.

However, at least one default _Interceptor_ can be configured : the _authenticationInterceptor_. 

In the case where one would like to add an interceptor, it's enough to add the associated entry containing the interceptor identifier, under the _ou=interceptors_ entry. It must have an order. Here are the elements that can be configured in such a case :

| AttributeType | type | default value | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| **ads-interceptorid** | _String_ | N/A | The unique identifier for this Interceptor |
| ads-enabled | _boolean_  | false | Tells if the Interceptor is enabled |
| description | _String_  | N/A | A short optional description |
| ads-interceptororder | _int_ | N/A | The position in the chain for this interceptor |
| ads-interceptorclassname | _String_ | N/A | The class implementing this interceptor |


### Authentication Interceptor

This _Interceptor_ is in charge of managing the users authentication. It is associated with _[Authenticators](#authenticators)_, and with _[Password Policies](#password-policies)_.

#### Authenticators

We may have various _Authenticator_ declared for a given server. The default server has three different _Authenticators_, which are :

* anonymousAuthenticator : used for anonymous requests
* simpleAuthenticator : handle simple authentication, based on a password
* strongAuthenticator : handle SASL authentication.

One can add a new _Authenticator_, if needed. It's just a matter of creating a new entry under the _ou=authenticators,ads-interceptorId=authenticationInterceptor,ou=interceptors_ entry, containing the two following elements :

| AttributeType | type | default value | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| **ads-authenticatorId** | _String_ | N/A | The unique identifier for this Authenticator |
| ads-enabled | _boolean_  | false | Tells if the Partition is enabled |
| description | _String_  | N/A | A short optional description |
| **ads-authenticatorClass** | _String_ | N/A | The FQCN for the class implementing the AUthenticator |


### Password Policies

There are many possible configurable options for the _PasswordPolicy_ system. Here is a list of all the options. See the [password policy draft](https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-behera-ldap-password-policy-10.txt) for an indept explanation of the respective attributes :

| AttributeType | type | default value | Description |

| ads-pwdValidator | _String_ | N/A | The PasswordValidator FQCN (will use DefaultPasswordValidator if not provided) |


## Partitions

The _Partition_ is where the server stores your data. There are many parts that need to be configured in order to obtain the best performances out of the server. It's also the part of the configuration you are more likely to modify, adding new _Partitions_ or adding new _Indexes_.

You may have more than one _Partition_ in your _DirectoryService_. There are at least three default _Partition_s, _ou=system_, _ou=config_ and _ou=schema_ _Partition_. ou=system is a _JDBM_ _Partition_ and the two others are _LDIF_ partitions.

### JDBM Partition

A _JDBM Partition_ has the following configurable options :

| AttributeType | type | default value | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| **ads-partitionid** | _String_ | N/A | The unique identifier for this Partition |
| ads-enabled | _boolean_  | false | Tells if the Partition is enabled |
| description | _String_  | N/A | A short optional description |
| **ads-partitionsuffix** | _String_ | N/A | The partition DN |
| ads-contextEntry | _String_ | N/A | The entry associated with the suffix (in LDIF format) |
| ads-partitionSyncOnWrite | _boolean_ | true | Tells the server to flush on disk on each write |

Once the above elements have been added, the _Partition_ is available. You still have to create some mandatory indexes though.

#### Indexes

Each _Partition_ have indexes, some are mandatory, and others are user provided. Here are the mandatory indexes :

| Index | role |
|---|---|
| apacheRdn | Stores the RDN for the entry, and the relation to its parent's RDN |
| apachePresence | Used to index the attributeTypes used in the entry |
| apacheOneAlias | Stores the aliases one level below the current entry |
| apacheSubAlias | Stores the aliases below the current entry |
| apacheAlias | Stores the aliases |
| objectClass | Stores the relation between an ObjectClass an the entry using it |
| entryCSN | Stores the CSN for each entry |
| administrativeRole | Stores the entries that are AdminstrativePoints |


##### Indexed Attribute

Indexed attributes have a type, depending on the _Partition_ type they are associated with. Currently, we have only one type, _JdbmIndex_. They have specific configurable elements.

Each index attribute has four basic elements that can be configured :

| AttributeType | type | default value | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| **ads-indexAttributeId** | _String_ | N/A | The unique identifier for this indexedAttribute |
| ads-enabled | _boolean_  | false | Tells if the IntexedAttribute is enabled |
| description | _String_  | N/A | A short optional description |

The _JdbmIndex_ type of index has some more configurable elements, all optional :

| AttributeType | type | default value | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| ads-indexFileName | _String_ | N/A | The index file name (default to the associated attributeType name) |
| ads-indexWorkingDir | _String_ | N/A | The index working directory |
| ads-indexNumDupLimit | _int_ | 512 | The maximum number of values for a single key before we use a sub-tree |
| ads-indexCacheSize | _int_ | 100 | The number of cached pages for this index |


# Servers

As we can see, we can start more than one server (a.k.a service). We have :

* a LDAP server
* a Kerberos server
* a changePassword server
* an HTTP Server
* a NTP Server
* a DHCP server
* a DNS server

There is a distinction though between the servers backed by a _DirectoryService_, and those that aren't (like the HTTP and NTP servers). 

All the _DirectoryService_ backed servers share some common parameters, which are exposed in the following table :

| AttributeType | type | default value | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| ads-searchBaseDN | _Dn_ | N/A | The place were to start looking for authentication informations |
| ads-serverId | _String_ | N/A | The server unique name |
| ads-enabled | _boolean_  | N/A | Tells if the Server is enabled |
| description | _String_  | N/A | A short optional description |

A server can define more than one transports : for instance, the Kerberos server uses UDP and TCP transports.

## Transports

### Repl Consumers

This part of the configuration deals with the replication. It provides all the information for a server to become a consumer. A server can have many different consumers set. 

All the consumers are stored under the _ou=replConsumers_ entry, under the respective server entry.

Here are the configurable elements :

| AttributeType | type | default value | Description |

| ads-replConsumerImpl | _String_ | ReplicationConsumerImpl | The implementation |
| ads-replCookie | _byte[]_ | N/A | The last received cookie |


### Extended Op Handlers

An LDAP server can handle _ExtendedOperations_, assuming it has the code to do so. In **ApacheDS**, we do that by associating a _Java_ class with each _ExtendedOperation_. We may provide more _ExtendedOperations_ in the future. The list of supported _ExtendedOperations_ is given below :

* CertGenerationRequest : Generate a certificate on demand
* GracefulShutdownRequest : Requires the server to shutdown gracefully
* StartTLSExtendedOperation : Process the StartTLS request
* StoredProcedureExtendedOperation : Execute a Stored procedure

Adding a new _ExntedeOperatonHandler_ is just a matter of adding a new entry under the _ou=extendedOpHandlers_ entry, with the given elements :

| AttributeType | type | default value | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| ads-enabled | _boolean_  | true | Tells if the ExtendedOpHandler system is enabled |
| description | _String_  | N/A | A short optional description |
| **ads-extendedOpId** | _String_ | N/A | The ExtendedOpHandler unique identifier |
| **ads-extendedOpHandlerClass** | _String_ | N/A | The class FQCN that implements the handler |


### SASL Mechanisms

We have various SASL mechanisms, which can be configured. the list of supported SASL mechanisms is :

* CRAM-MD5
* DIGEST-MD5
* GSS-SPNEGO
* GSSAPI
* NTLM
* SIMPLE

This list is stored in the configuration. It's possible to add new mechanisms if needed, simply by adding an entry containing those elements, under the _ou=saslMechHandlers_

| AttributeType | type | default value | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| ads-enabled | _boolean_  | true | Tells if the Transport system is enabled |

| **ads-saslMechClassName** | _String_ | N/A | The mechanism class name|
| ads-ntlmMechProvider | _String_ | N/A | The NTLM provider |

## Kerberos Server

The _KerberosServer_ configuration is an important part of the configuration. It depends on a _DirectoryService_ too, as most of the informations managed by a _KerberosServer_ are store there.

The list of attributes that can be modified is exposed in the following table. 

| AttributeType | type | default value | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| ads-enabled | _boolean_  | true | Tells if the KerberosServer is enabled |
| description | _String_  | N/A | A short optional description |
| ads-krbAllowableClockSkew | _int_ | 300000 | The allowable clock skew in milliseconds (5 minutes) |

| ads-krbKdcPrincipal | _String_ | krbtgt/EXAMPLE.COM@EXAMPLE.COM | The service principal name |
| ads-krbMaximumRenewableLifetime | _long_ | 1000 * 60 * 60 * 24 * 7 | The maximum renewable lifetime in millisconds (7 days) |
| ads-krbMaximumTicketLifetime | _long_ | 1000 * 60 * 60 * 24 | he maximum ticket lifetime in milliseconds (24 h) |
| ads-krbPrimaryRealm | _String_ | EXAMPLE.COM | The primary realm  |
| ads-krbBodyChecksumVerified | _boolean_ | true | Whether to verify the body checksum |


Of course, a _Transport_ has to be defined under the _KerberosServer_ entry (see [Transports](#transports)).

## Http Server

We have a Http Server embedded, which is used to manage some parts of the server. One can inject a web application, which has direct access to the embedded LdapServer, for instance. It can be useful for sending LDAP requests using DSML, for instance.

There is one single element that can be configured :

| AttributeType | type | default value | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| ads-enabled | _boolean_  | true | Tells if the HttpServer is enabled |
| description | _String_  | N/A | A short optional description |
| ads-httpConfFile | _String_  | N/A | The configuration file for this server |

An _HttpServer_ without webApps is pretty useless, we now have to configure the underlying web applications


### Http Web Apps

Each _WebApp_ configuration must be added under the _ou=webapps_ entry. Here are the configurable elements :

| AttributeType | type | default value | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| ads-enabled | _boolean_  | true | Tells if the HttpServer is enabled |
| description | _String_  | N/A | A short optional description |
| **ads-httpWarFile** | _String_  | N/A | The WAR file to use |
| **ads-id** | _String_  | N/A | The unique ID for this WebApp |
| **ads-httpAppCtxPath** | _String_  | N/A | The context |

Here is an example of configuration :

```text
dn: ads-id=webApp1,ou=httpWebApps,ads-serverId=httpServer,ou=servers,ads-directoryServiceId=default,ou=config
objectclass: top
objectclass: ads-base
objectclass: ads-httpWebApp
ads-Id: webApp1
ads-httpWarFile: war file 1
ads-httpAppCtxPath: /home/app1
```


## Change Password Server
To be added...

# Bean graph

The following picture represent the structure of the container used to store the configuration inside the server. The yellow beans are abstract beans, extended by specific beans.

The bold links mean we can have more than one instance of a bean.
