# 4.1.1.4 - Server side password hashing

By default **ApacheDS** does not store user's password hashed. From the security point of view, this is not a good thing.

For this reason, a mechanism has been added that can automatically hash passwords that are added or modified, beside the standard **PasswordModify** extended operation.

Any entry containing the **userPassword** attrribute will automatically sees its value hashed ac cordingly to an algorithm that can be chosend at start time.

We use a specific interceptor (_passwordHashing_) that needs to be activated to enable this feature. This can be done using _Apache Directory Studio_, by clicking in the _Enable server-side password hashing_ box in the _LDAP/LDAPS Servers_ tab, section _advanced_:

The hashing method can be one of:

* SHA
* SSHA (salted SHA)
* MD5
* SMD5
* CRYPT
* SHA-256
* SSHA-256
* SHA-384
* SSHA-384
* SHA-512
* SSHA-512
* PKCS552

Once restarted, any entry containing a **userPassword** attruibute modification or addition will get teh associated value hashed.
