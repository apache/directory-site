# 4.1.1.4 - Server side password hashing

By default **ApacheDS** does not store user's password hashed. From the security point of view, this is not a good thing.

For this reason, a mechanism has been added that can automatically hash passwords that are added or modified, beside the standard **PasswordModify** extended operation.

Any entry containing the **userPassword** attribute will automatically sees its values hashed accordingly to an algorithm that can be chosen.

We use a specific interceptor (_passwordHashing_) that needs to be activated to enable this feature. This can be done using _Apache Directory Studio_, by clicking in the _Enable server-side password hashing_ box in the _LDAP/LDAPS Servers_ tab, section _advanced_:

The hashing method can be one of:

* SHA
* SSHA (salted SHA)
* MD5
* SMD5
* CRYPT
* SHA-256
* SSHA-256
* SHA-384
* SSHA-384
* SHA-512
* SSHA-512
* PKCS552

Once restarted, any entry containing a **userPassword** attruibute modification or addition will get the associated value hashed. 

Another option would be to inject the interceptor configuration in the server configuration, using a **LDIF** file like:

    # turn on Server-side password hash
    dn: ads-interceptorId=passwordHashingInterceptor,ou=interceptors,ads-directoryServiceId=default,ou=config
    changetype: modify
    replace: ads-enabled
    ads-enabled: TRUE
    -
    replace: ads-hashalgorithm
    ads-algorithm: &lt;the selected algorithm&gt;
    -
