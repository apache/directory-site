# 0 - Community
This chapter explains how to work with the community around the project. The ASF is a community of volunteers, most of them working out of their working time to get the best possible software available to the users, for free. 

As a community, we appreciate feedbacks, bug reports, even criticisms, but we value contributions as the best way to make this collaborative work a better software.
