# 4.1.1.1 - Anonymous Authentication

When we don't provide a name or password while proceeding to a Bind, we enter into an Anonymous mode. This is a mode that the server must allow, otherwise the user won't be authenticated.

It worth noticing that one can do a search on a server without first authenticating : the search will be done with an anonymous status (in other words, an Anonymous session will be created in this case).
