# 4.2.1 - Introduction

First of all, one has to understand that Authorization in this context
involves four components. The principle is :
 
<DIV class="info" markdown="1">
 grants <b>Users</b> authorization to proceed some <b>Action</b> on a set of
<b>Items</b> in a defined <b>Area</b>
</DIV>

Let's define the four components.

**Users** :

> the set of entity being able to do some action. It can be every user,
> the entry owner, a list of users, members of a group or a selection in the
> DIT. Basically, a **user** is defined as an entry in the DIT. 

**Action** :

> Generally speaking, a grant or denial to do something, depending on the
> selected item (read, delete, etc).

**Items** :
> An **item** is an element of the DIT. It can be an Entry, an
> AttributeType, some AttributeValues. It can also define some constraints
> that will apply on the selected entries.

**Area** :

> It defines the set of entries on which the defined ACI applies. It can
> be the whole DIT, a part of the DIT, a selection of entries, an Entry.

We implement those elements using **ACI**s.

The following chapters will present you the system inside out.
