# 2.1.1 - Adding Entries

We will see how to add new entries into the server. Assuming that we have already created a partition (see [Adding a partition](1.4.3-adding-partition.html)), we will use this added partition as a root for the entry addition. We will also create the _ou=people_ entry.

We try to add a new user to the "Seven Seas" partition. The data for the entry is inspired by "Peter Pan" and provided by this LDIF file ([Captain hook](resources/captain-hook-hierarchy.ldif)): 

	# File captain_hook.ldif
	dn: ou=people,o=sevenSeas
	objectclass: organizationalUnit
	objectclass: top
	ou: people

	dn: cn=James Hook,ou=people,o=sevenSeas
	objectclass: inetOrgPerson
	objectclass: organizationalPerson
	objectclass: person
	objectclass: top
	cn: James Hook
	description: A pirate captain and Peter Pan's nemesis
	sn: Hook
	mail: jhook@neverland
	userpassword: peterPan
	
The first entry creates the _ou=people_ container, which is necessary otherwise we can't inject the second entry.

## Using the command line

You have to use an authorized user to inject the entry, here, _cn=Horatio Nelson,ou=people,o=sevenSeas_ :

	$ ldapmodify -h zanzibar -p 10389 -D "cn=Horatio Nelson,ou=people,o=sevenSeas" -w pass \\
    	-a -f captain_hook.ldif
	adding new entry cn=James Hook,ou=people,o=sevenSeas
	$

Afterwards a new entry is successfully created within the "Seven Seas" partition by user "Horatio Nelson". The '+' sign in the attributes list of the _ldapsearch_ command causes ApacheDS to return the operational attributes, which demonstrate this.

	$ ldapsearch -h zanzibar -p 10389 -b "o=sevenSeas" -s sub "(cn=James Hook)" +
	version: 1
	dn: cn=James Hook,ou=people,o=sevenSeas
	accessControlSubentries: cn=sevenSeasAuthorizationRequirementsACISubentry,o=sevenSeas
	creatorsName: cn=Horatio Nelson,ou=people,o=sevenSeas
	createTimestamp: 20061203140109Z

## Using Apache Directory Studio

Once connected on the server with studio, you should be able to inject new entries -assuming you have the sufficent priviledge - :

![Import entry with studio](images/import-entry-studio.png)

Then select the LDIF file containing the entry :

![LDIF import](images/ldif-import-file-select.png)

When imported, the _log_ windows should contain this message :

    #!RESULT OK
	#!CONNECTION ldap://localhost:10389
	#!DATE 2012-10-30T14:36:21.294
	dn: ou=people,o=sevenSeas
	changetype: add
	ou: people
	objectclass: organizationalUnit
	objectclass: top

	#! RESULT OK
	#! CONNECTION ldap://localhost:10389
	#! DATE 2012-10-30T14:36:21.320
	dn: cn=James Hook,ou=people,o=sevenSeas
	changetype: add
	mail: jhook@neverland
	userpassword: peterPan
	description: A pirate captain and Peter Pan's nemesis
	objectclass: inetOrgPerson
	objectclass: organizationalPerson
	objectclass: person
	objectclass: top
	sn: Hook
	cn: James Hook

This is it for this basic introduction on how to add entries in the server. There are other ways, like using and LDAP API, to do the same thing.
