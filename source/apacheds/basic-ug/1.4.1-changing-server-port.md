# 1.4.1 - Changing the server port for LDAP

This section describes how to change to port for the LDAP protocol. There are two ways to do that : either you use the configuration plugin available in **Apache Directory Studio**, or you update the LDIF partition that contains the configuration.

{{% toc %}}

## The task and how to accomplish it

By default the LDAP server listens on port 10389 (unencrypted or StartTLS) and 10636 (SSL). It is quite common to run LDAP on 389, which is the well-known port for this protocol, but that requires the server to be started with a root user (or with sudo). Of course other options are imaginable as well. Changing the LDAP port is a good example for adjusting the existing Spring configuration as introduced in the last section.

<DIV class="note" markdown="1">
Due to traditional Unix security restrictions, ports less than 1024 were "trusted". Thus on a Unix-System, a non-root process must listen on a port greater than 1023.
</DIV>


Basically, there are two cases :
* The server is not started
* The server is started

We will see how to change the port in those two cases.

### Using Apache Directory Studio

#### The server is started

The best solution is to connect on the server using Studio, and to open it's configuration :

<CENTER>
![Studio port configuration](images/studio-port-config1.png)
</CENTER>

When you select this menu, you will get the main configuration screen, containing the port for LDAP and LDAPS :

<CENTER>
![Studio port configuration](images/studio-port-config2.png)
</CENTER>


Now, change the values of _port_ to your needs, then save the configuration. You have to restart the server afterwards in order to take this change into effect.

#### The server is not started

You can start it and update the configuration, of course. But if you want to configure the server when it's stopped, you will have to load the configuration file, which is on _.../instances/default/conf/config.ldif_, when the server has been installed using the default setting.

Opening this file will open the exact same window :

<CENTER>
![Studio port configuration](images/studio-port-config2.png)
</CENTER>

You can update the _ports_ and save the file.

	Note that you will requite write access on this file !
</DIV>

### Modifying the configuration LDIF partition

All the **ApacheDS** configuration is stored as a LDIF file, and can be modified either using a text editor (although we don't consider this as a safe practice) or using a Modify request on a running server. 

<DIV class="info" markdown="1">
	Modifying the configuration on a running server will **not** change the listening port of the running server. You will have to relaunch the server in order to get this new configuration to be available.
</DIV>


The configuration is stored as a set of LDAP entries, so you can update one of them. In order to modify the entry containing the ports, you have first to find it, and second to send a valid modify request.

All the **ApacheDS** configuration is stored under the _ou=config_ partition. The ports are stored in some entries under _DN: ldap,ou=transports,ads-serverId=ldapServer,ou=servers,ads-directoryServiceId=default,ou=config_ (obviously, dependning on your installation, this DN might change : the _ads-directoryServiceId_ may have a different name, so is the _ads-serverId_). In any case, the _ou=transports_ branch contains two entries :

for LDAP :

	dn: ads-transportid=ldap,ou=transports,ads-serverId=ldapServer,ou=servers,ad
	 s-directoryServiceId=default,ou=config
	ads-systemport: 10389
	ads-enabled: TRUE
	ads-transportnbthreads: 8
	ads-transportaddress: 0.0.0.0
	ads-transportid: ldap
	objectclass: ads-transport
	objectclass: ads-tcpTransport
	objectclass: ads-base
	objectclass: top
	 
and for LDAPS :

	dn: ads-transportid=ldaps,ou=transports,ads-serverId=ldapServer,ou=servers,a
	 ds-directoryServiceId=default,ou=config
	ads-systemport: 10636
	ads-transportenablessl: TRUE
	ads-enabled: TRUE
	ads-transportaddress: 0.0.0.0
	ads-transportid: ldaps
	objectclass: ads-transport
	objectclass: ads-tcpTransport
	objectclass: ads-base
	objectclass: top
	
You just have to send a ModifyRequest using such a LDIF :

	dn: ads-transportid=ldaps,ou=transports,ads-serverId=ldapServer,ou=servers,ads
	 -directoryServiceId=default,ou=config
	changetype: modify
	replace: ads-systemport
	ads-systemport: 10637
	-

(here, we have modified the LDAPS Port from 10636 to 10637)

Those modification can be done directly on the _config.ldif_ file, but you won't have any syntax check if you do so.
