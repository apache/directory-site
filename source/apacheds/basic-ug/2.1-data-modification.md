# 2.1 - Data modification

We will first expose the way you inject entries in _Apache Directory Server_. There are four type of operations you can use for that :
* Addition
* Deletion
* Modification
* Move and/or rename

(The last operation allows a user to move, rename or move and rename entries).

We will show how to add or delete entries in the following chapters, just to show you how it works with _Apache Directory Server_. There is nothing really different with any other servers.

For further information about data modifications, you should either check the [Apache LDAP API documentation](../../api/index.html) documentation, or the [Apache Directory Studio documentation](../../studio/users-guide.html).
