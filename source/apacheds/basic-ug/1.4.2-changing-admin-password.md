# 1.4.2 - Changing the admin password

This section describes the steps necessary to change the administrator password. Follow the instructions provided here step by step.

## Step one: Changing the value in the system partition

While the server is up and running, change the value of the _userPassword_ attribute of the admin (uid=admin,ou=system) via LDAP. There are several ways to accomplish this task. In the following, we use the Eclipse based Apache Directory Studio.

A new LDAP connection with this tool is created via "New Connection ..." from the _Connections_ view. Enter your connection data in the first step ...

... and in the next step, enter the admin DN _uid=admin,ou=system_ and the current password (default is "secret"). Saving the password is not necessary, we will change it anyway.

Click _Finish_ to establish the connection.

Afterwards, modify the value of the _userPassword_ attribute of the entry _uid=admin,ou=system_. Navigate to the entry in the DIT (_LDAP Browser_ view), and double click the attribute in the _Entry Editor_ view:

The Password Editor dialog shows up; enter the new password. You can optionally select a hash algorithm like _SHA_. In this case, the password will be stored one-way encrypted in the attribute value -- not a bad idea.

Pressing _OK_ stores the new value. Close the connection and shutdown the server.

## Step two: Verification

Verify that you can login as admin with the new password. With Apache Directory Studio, you can change the properties of the existing connection profile via a right click in the _Connections_ view and a selection of the _Properties_ menu item. The following dialog appears:

Enter the new password and press _OK_. Establishing a connection should now work.
