# 2.2.1 - Simple search

Basically, a search in **LDAP** requires a few parameters :
* A server on which we will send the request
* A port for this server
* A base _DN_, the location where to start the search from
* A filter to select the entries to be returned
* The user doing the search
* A password if the user is not already bound
* A scope, defining the depth we should look for
* The list of attributes to return

There are several other options, which will be exposed in the next chapter.

## Doing a Simple Search on the command line

Here is an exemple of search done on the base we have created :

	$ ldapsearch -h zanzibar -p 10389 -b "o=sevenSeas" -s sub "(cn=James Hook)" +
	version: 1
	dn: cn=James Hook,ou=people,o=sevenSeas
	accessControlSubentries: cn=sevenSeasAuthorizationRequirementsACISubentry,o=sevenSeas
	creatorsName: cn=Horatio Nelson,ou=people,o=sevenSeas
	createTimestamp: 20061203140109Z

Here, we see that we are connecting to the **zanzibar** server, on its **10389** port. As we haven't provided any user, this is an anonymous search, which should be allowed if the server accept anonymous searches.
We then have the base _DN_, **"o=sevenseas"**, the filter **"(cn=James Hook)"** and the scope : **"sub"**. The last parameter, **"+"**, asks the server to return all the operational attributes.

The result is just shown as a result of the command (here, we get back one single entry).
