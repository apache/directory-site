# ApacheDS v2.0 Basic User's Guide

This guide is primarily for people new to ApacheDS 2.0. If you plan to use the server as is, maybe even for your first LDAP experience, you'll (hopefully) find all information necessary to do so. Only basic configuration tasks are covered. Learn more about the options you have (and many other things) in the [ApacheDS v2.0 Advanced User's Guide](advanced-user-guide.html).

**LDAP** is a complex set of technology, _Apache Directory Server_ is offering more than just **LDAP**, so it's good to get a quick grip on the server.

## About this guide

Getting started. Learn how to download and install ApacheDS 2.0 on different platforms, connect to it with various clients (graphical tools among others), manipulate the data within your directory and integrate ApacheDS with other software. The same sample data, provided as a download, is used through the whole guide.
