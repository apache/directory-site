# 1.1.4 - KDC (Key Distribution Center)

The **KDC** contains three components :
* an Authentication Service
* a Ticket Granting Service
* a database (ApacheDS)

The **KDC** role is to authenticate users and distribute tickets based on the information stored in its database.

The **Apache Kerberos Server** contains all these three components and hence is a **KDC**.

<DIV class="info" markdown="1">
We could allow the **Kerberos Server** to manage more than one **KDC**, but this is not currently possible.

The **KDC** is associated with a **Realm**.

The following schema expose the way the **KDC** works :

</DIV>

In order to use a service, the client needs to get a ticket for this service from the **KDC**. This requires a two step process, where the client first authenticates himself, and then get back a ticket to use with the targeted server.

Though the Autehntication and Ticket Granting services look like running in separate servers, a signle Kerberos server implementation oftent contains both.
