# 1.1.2 - Principals

The Kerberos **Principal** is any entity to which the server can assign a **Ticket**. Typically, we can think of three kinds of **Principals** :

    * Users
    * Services
    * Hosts

Each **Principal** is unique in the Kerberos database. This is the way we identify the entity.

A Kerberos **Principal** is a combination of three parts :
    
    * the name (the primary)
    * an optional instance
    * the realm they are associated with

The optional instance is used to provide more than one role to an entity, without having to create N Principals for a single user (an administrator is also a normal user, and it's good to qualify the user by adding his admin qualificiation in one **Principal** to create a new and easy to remember **Principal**)

The **Principal** syntax is the following :

    
    <primary> ['/' <instance>]* '@' <realm>

<DIV class="info" markdown="1">
For hosts, we use "host" as a primary, and the instances are the hostnames.
</DIV>

Those are examples of valid **Principals**

    ::test
    john@APACHE.ORG                             A user
    john/admin@APACHE.ORG                       A user who is an admin
    host/www.apache.org/apache.org@APACHE.ORG   A host with two hostnames
    ldap/www.apache.org@APACHE.ORG              A service (Ldap server)
