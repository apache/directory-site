# 1.1.1 - Realms

A **Realm** is associated with a Kerberos administrative domain. In other words, it covers everything the Kerberos server manages :
* Users
* Services

Note that a Kerberos Server manages **one** Realm only, a Realm can be managed by more than one Kerberos server : this is mandatory to avoid a single point of failure, if a Kerberos server halts for any reason.

## Realm name

In order to distinguish the **Realms**, we give them a unique name. This name can be anything, but a convention is to use the DNS name of the Kerberos server, and to use uppercase.

For instance, say that th Kerberos server is installed on a machine whose domain name is **apache.org**, then we will use **APACHE.ORG** as the **Realm** name (but you could use **Apache.org** or even **MyApacheDomain**).

<DIV class="info" markdown="1">
Note that the name is case sensitive. **apache.org** is a different realm than **APACHE.ORG**.
</DIV>

The **Realm** name wil be used all over Kerberos to name **Principals** and **Services**

## Default Realm for ApacheDS Kerberos Server

When **ApacheDS Kerberos Server** installed, the default **Realm** name is set to **EXAMPLE.COM**. This can be changed  either using **Studio**, by accessing the server configuration and changing the 'Primary KDC Realm', as show in this picture :

</DIV>

or by modifying the LDIF configuration directly, by modifying the following entry :

    
    dn: ads-serverId=kerberosServer,ou=servers,ads-directoryServiceId=default,ou=config
    ...
    ads-krbprimaryrealm: EXAMPLE.COM
    ...
