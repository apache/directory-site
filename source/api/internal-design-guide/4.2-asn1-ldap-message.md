# ASN/1 LDAP grammar

The **LDAP** grammar is defined in [RFC 4511, appendix B](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4511#appendix-B).


Here it is:

## LdapMessage

The **LDAPMessage** grammar starts with this part:

```text
        LDAPMessage ::= SEQUENCE {
             messageID       INTEGER (0 .. maxInt),
             protocolOp      CHOICE {

                  bindResponse          BindResponse,
                  unbindRequest         UnbindRequest,
                  searchRequest         SearchRequest,
                  searchResEntry        SearchResultEntry,
                  searchResDone         SearchResultDone,
                  searchResRef          SearchResultReference,
                  modifyRequest         ModifyRequest,
                  modifyResponse        ModifyResponse,

                  delRequest            DelRequest,
                  delResponse           DelResponse,
                  modDNRequest          ModifyDNRequest,
                  modDNResponse         ModifyDNResponse,
                  compareRequest        CompareRequest,

                  intermediateResponse  IntermediateResponse },
             controls       [0] Controls OPTIONAL }
```

We have three parts:

* The message *ID*
* The protocol part
* The optional controls

The following picture gives a clear view of the existing transitions:

<img src="images/asn1-ldap-message.png" alt="LDAP message state machine" width="100%"/>

The green boxes are sub-transitions, which will be descibed below. 
The red arrow indicates which transition are mandatory.
Each transition is based on the tag used between two states.
Dashed arrows are optional transitions.

There are 15 mandatory transitions:

* _ADD_REQUEST_STATE_
* _ADD_RESPONSE_STATE_
* _BIND_REQUEST_STATE_
* _BIND_RESPONSE_STATE_
* _COMPARE_REQUEST_STATE_
* _COMPARE_RESPONSE_STATE_
* _DEL_RESPONSE_STATE_
* _EXTENDED_RESPONSE_STATE_
* _MODIFY_DN_REQUEST_STATE_
* _MODIFY_DN_RESPONSE_STATE_
* _MODIFY_REQUEST_STATE_
* _MODIFY_RESPONSE_STATE_
* _SEARCH_REQUEST_STATE_
* _SEARCH_RESULT_DONE_STATE_
* _SEARCH_RESULT_ENTRY_STATE_


Here is a flat representation of a **LDAP** message structure, where we see the encapsulated **TLVs**:

Now, here is the sub-message **protocolOp**:

<img src="images/asn1-protocol-op.png" alt="protocol operations state machine" width="100%"/>

It covers all the existing **LDAP** messages.

## LdapResult

The **LDAPResult** element is part of all the **LDAP** response. It contains the following informations:

* A result code, indicating either a success (code 0) or an error (code from 1 to 80, but it may be higher in a future version)
* A **DN** representing the associated entry 
* A diagnostic message in case of an error
* An optional list of **LDAP URL** that may be able to process the operation.

Here is the complete grammar, as defined in [RFC4511](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4511):

```text
LDAPResult ::= SEQUENCE {
             resultCode         ENUMERATED {

             diagnosticMessage  OCTET STRING,
             referral           [3] Referral OPTIONAL }

        Referral ::= SEQUENCE SIZE (1..MAX) OF uri OCTET STRING

        URI ::= LDAPString     -- limited to characters permitted in
                               -- URIs

```

The associated state machine is given by this schema:

<img src="images/asn1-ldap-result.png" alt="LDAPResult state machine" width="100%"/>

## Controls

The **Control** grammar is the following:

```text
     Controls ::= SEQUENCE OF control Control

     Control ::= SEQUENCE {
             controlType             OCTET STRING,
             criticality             BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
             controlValue            OCTET STRING OPTIONAL 
```

The associated state machine is given by this schema:

<img src="images/asn1-controls.png" alt="Controls state machine" width="100%"/>

There is no mandatory transition.

## AbandonRequest operation

The **AbandonRequest** message grammar is the following:

```text
AbandonRequest ::= [APPLICATION 16] INTEGER (0 .. maxInt)
```

The state machine for this operation is already described in the [LdapMessage](#ldapmessage) state machine. The operation code (0x50) is completed with the *ID* of the message to be abandonned.

## AddRequest operation

The **AddRequest** message grammar is the following:

```text
AddRequest ::= [APPLICATION 8] SEQUENCE {
             entry           OCTET STRING,
             attributes      AttributeList }

AttributeList ::= SEQUENCE OF attribute Attribute

Attribute ::= PartialAttribute(WITH COMPONENTS {
             ...,
             vals (SIZE(1..MAX))})

PartialAttribute ::= SEQUENCE {
             type       OCTET STRING,
             vals       SET OF value OCTET STRING }
```

Its state machine is shown in this picture:

<img src="images/asn1-add-request.png" alt="AddRequest state machine" width="100%"/>

For a **AddRequest**, only one state is mandatory and must be followed by another state:

* _ENTRY_STATE_

## AddResponse operation

The **Add** operation response is described by this part of the **LDAP** grammar:

```text
    AddResponse ::= [APPLICATION 9] LDAPResult
```

The associated state machine is shown below:

<img src="images/asn1-add-response.png" alt="AddResponse state machine" width="100%"/>


There are no mandatory state.

## BindRequest operation

The **BindRequest** message grammar is the following:

```text
        BindRequest ::= [APPLICATION 0] SEQUENCE {
             version                 INTEGER (1 ..  127),
             name                    OCTET STRING,
             authentication          AuthenticationChoice }

        AuthenticationChoice ::= CHOICE {
             simple                  [0] OCTET STRING,
             sasl                    [3] SaslCredentials,
             ...  }

        SaslCredentials ::= SEQUENCE {
             mechanism               OCTET STRING,
             credentials             OCTET STRING OPTIONAL }
```

Its state machine is shown in this picture:

<img src="images/asn1-bind-request.png" alt="BindRequest state machine" width="100%"/>

We have two flavors of **Bind**:
* **Simple** bind, which uses a name and its credentials, in clear text
* **SASL** bind, which use a name, a mechanism and some added data. A dialog will be established, in which some responses and requests will be exchanged, until the authentication is established.

For a **BindRequest**, only two states are mandatory and must be followed by another state:

* _VERSION_STATE_
* _NAME_STATE_

## BindResponse operation

The **BindResponse** message contains two elements:

* A _LdapResult_ element 
* An optional response used in a aunthentication dialogue, if the **BindRequest** message was a **SASL** one

```text
BindResponse ::= [APPLICATION 1] SEQUENCE {
             COMPONENTS OF LDAPResult,
             serverSaslCreds    [7] OCTET STRING OPTIONAL }
```

The associated state machine is shown below:

<img src="images/asn1-bind-response.png" alt="BindResponse state machine" width="100%"/>

Just because we may have some data after the **LDAPResult** element, we use a special version of the **LDAPResult** state machine:

<img src="images/asn1-ldap-result-BR.png" alt="BindResponse LDAPResult state machine" width="100%"/>

In any case, two states are mandatory:

* _RESULT_CODE_BR_STATE_
* _MATCHED_DN_BR_STATE_

## CompareRequest operation

The **CompareRequest** message grammar is the following:

```text
CompareRequest ::= [APPLICATION 14] SEQUENCE {
             entry           OCTET STRING,
             ava             AttributeValueAssertion }

AttributeValueAssertion ::= SEQUENCE {
             attributeDesc   OCTET STRING,
             assertionValue  OCTET STRING }
```

Its state machine is shown in this picture:

<img src="images/asn1-compare-request.png" alt="CompareRequest state machine" width="100%"/>

<img src="images/asn1-extended-response.png" alt="ExtendedResponse state machine" width="100%"/>


There are no mandatory state.

Just because we may have some data after the **LDAPResult** element, we use a special version of the **LDAPResult** state machine:

<img src="images/asn1-ldap-result-ER.png" alt="ExtendedResponse LDAPResult state machine" width="100%"/>

In any case, two states are mandatory:

* _RESULT_CODE_ER_STATE_
* _MATCHED_DN_ER_STATE_

### SubstringFilter

The **SubstringFilter** grammar part is given below:

```text
SubstringFilter ::= SEQUENCE {
             type           OCTET STRING,
             substrings     SEQUENCE SIZE (1..MAX) OF substring CHOICE {
                  initial [0] OCTET STRING,
                  any     [1] OCTET STRING,
                  final   [2] OCTET STRING }
             }
```

The associated state machine is shown below:

<img src="images/asn1-substrings-filter.png" alt="Substrings Filter state machine" width="100%"/>

There is no mandatory transition

## SearchResultDone

The **SearchResultDone** message is described by this part of the **LDAP** grammar:

```text
    SearchResultDone ::= [APPLICATION 5] LDAPResult
```

The associated state machine is shown below:

<img src="images/asn1-search-result-done.png" alt="SearchResultDone state machine" width="100%"/>

There are no mandatory state.

## SearchResultEntry

The **SearchResultEntry** message is described by this part of the **LDAP** grammar:

```text
    SearchResultEntry ::= [APPLICATION 4] SEQUENCE {
             objectName      OCTET STRING,
             attributes      PartialAttributeList }

        PartialAttributeList ::= SEQUENCE OF
                             partialAttribute PartialAttribute

        PartialAttribute ::= SEQUENCE {
             type       OCTET STRING,
             vals       SET OF value OCTET STRING }
```

The associated state machine is shown below:

<img src="images/asn1-search-result-entry.png" alt="SearchResultEntry state machine" width="100%"/>

There are two mandatory transitions:

* _OBJECT_NAME_STATE_
* _PARTIAL_ATTRIBUTE_LIST_STATE_

## SearchResultReference

The **SearchResultReference** message is described by this part of the **LDAP** grammar:

```text
    SearchResultDone ::= [APPLICATION 5] LDAPResult
```

The associated state machine is shown below:

<img src="images/asn1-search-result-reference.png" alt="SearchResultReference state machine" width="100%"/>

## UnbindRequest operation

This is the simplest operation. Its **PDU** contains only 2 bytes: **0x42 0x00**.

```text
        UnbindRequest ::= [APPLICATION 2] NULL
```

Its state machine is already fully contained in the **LDAPMEssage** state machine, as it's encoded directly.
