# 4.1 - Schema

A **Schema** is a set of elements that are used by the **LDAP Server** to describe the data that are stored. The top two elements are **ObjectClass** and **AttributeType**. An **ObjectClass** is a container, describing what an **LDAP** entry can contain, while an **AttributeType** describe each singe element stored in this container.

The key here is that an **LDAP** entry uses **ObjectClasses** to list all the possible **AttributeTypes** that an entry can contain, some of them being mandatory, some other optional.

Now, there is more. We have many other **Schema Objects** that are colateral:

* **LdapComparator** (_ApacheDS_ specific)
* **DitContentRule**
* **DitStructureRule**
* **MatchingRule**
* **MatchingRuleUse**
* **NameForm**
* **Normalizer** (_ApacheDS_ specific)
* **Syntax**
* **SyntaxChecker** (_ApacheDS_ specific)

Most of those elements are defined in [RFC 4512](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4512), we have added three others (**LDdapComparator**, **Normalizer** and **SyntaxChecker**) in order to make the server easy to extend by adding some new ones.

Those **SchemaObjects** are used to refine the relation between elements, or define their syntax, or some other constraints. The most important ones are **LdapComparator**, **MatchingRule**, **Normalizer**, **Syntax** and **SyntaxChecker**. All of them have dependencies, exposed in this picture:
