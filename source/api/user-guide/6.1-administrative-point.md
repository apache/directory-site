# 6.1 - AdministrativePoint

<DIV class="note" markdown="1">
These classes are currently only used by the server. It will be available on the client side later on.
</DIV>

An _AdministrativePoint_ is an _entry_ in the _DIT_ which is associated with some _AdministrativeArea_. In **ApacheDS** we support 4 different kind of roles:

* ACI
* Collective Attributes
* SubSchema
* Triggers

We also have three different types of _AdministrativePoint_s:

* Autonomous AdministrativePoint (AAP)
* Specific AdministrativePoint (SAP)
* Inner AdministrativePoint (IAP)

Each of the roles comes in one of 3 'flavors' (except the SubSchema whch has only 2 flavors). So we have the following classes:

* AccessControl
    * AccessControlAAP
    * AccessControlSAP
    * AccessControlIAP
* CollectiveAttribute
    * CollectiveAttributeAAP
    * CollectiveAttributeSAP
    * CollectiveAttributeIAP
* Subschema
    * SubschemaAAP
    * SubschemaSAP
* Triggers
    * TriggerExecutionAAP
    * TriggerExecutionSAP
    * TriggerExecutionIAP

These classes stores the following information:

* dn : The DN of the root entry for this administration point.
* uuid : The associated entryUUID
* role : The Administrative role
* parent : The parent (if any) AdministrativePoint
* children : All the descendant of this AdministrativePoint
