# 1 - Introduction

This User Guide teaches developers how to use the Apache LDAP API. Throughout these documents, we have interspersed descriptions of features with snippets of code.  These code samples are used by our integration tests as well.

Hopefully there's enough here to get you started -- quickly.  If you feel like improving this document or have questions / suggestions, please post to the Apache Directory LDAP API mailing list.  All code and doc contributions are welcomed!
