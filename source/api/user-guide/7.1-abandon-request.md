# 7.1 AbandonRequest

This request is used to tell the server that a given request (sent previously) has been abandoned. The only required parameter is the *ID* field of a request you want to stop. 

```Java
    public interface AbandonRequest extends Request
    {
        /**
         * Gets the id of the request operation to terminate.
         * 
         * @return the id of the request message to abandon
         */
        int getAbandoned();


        /**
         * Sets the id of the request operation to terminate.
         * 
         * @param requestId the sequence id of the request message to abandon
         * @return The AbandonRequest instance
         */
        AbandonRequest setAbandoned( int requestId );
    }
```

There are two existing implementations that can used:

* _AbandonRequestImpl_ : The default implementation.
* _AbandonRequestDsml_ : An implementation used when you want to generate a DSML request

The _AbandonRequest_ message does not have a response, the abandonned request will just be stopped.

## Usage

It's pretty easy to do. You just to inject the ID of the request you want to abandon:

```Java
    connection.abandon( messageId );
```

This will interrupt the request whose ID equals _messageId_.

### Adding some controls

You can add a control in the _AbandonRequest_, once you create an instance of _AbandonRequestImpl_:


```Java
    AbandonRequest abandonRequest = new AbandonRequestImpl( messageId );

    // Add your control 
    abandonRequest.addControl( control );

    // Send the request
    connection.abandon( abandonRequest );
```
