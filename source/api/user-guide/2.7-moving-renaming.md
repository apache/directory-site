# 2.7 - Moving an renaming entries

LDAP allows you to do more than adding, deleting or modifying entries : you can also move them, or rename them. Here, you are not changing the content of an entry, but its position in the **DIT**, or its name.

Actually, changing an entry's name **may* have an impact on the entry's content, as the *DN* always contains elements that are part of the entry.

Both operation can be applied at the same time.

Actually the LDAP protocol reunite those two function into one call (**MODDN**, also called **MODRDN**), but for clarity, we defined three different methods, beside a fith one that mimic the LDAP protocol **MODDN** function  :

* _move( current DN, new superior DN )_
* _rename ( old DN, new DN[, keep the old RDN] )_
* _moveAndRename( current DN, new DN[, keep the old RDN])_
* _modifyDn_( ModifyDnRequest )

## Rename operation

## Move and Rename operation

## ModifyDn operation

## Asynchornous ModifyDn operation
