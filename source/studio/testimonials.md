### George Stoianov says:

> I have spend only a limited time with LDAP Studio maybe 1-2 hours, so
> far and I am really impressed with the way it works and behaves. I
> have seen other Linux GUI LDAP clients but they had limited
> capabilities in some ways, did not work in others or were not very
> user friendly, as subjective as that is, in my mind. Long story short
> they kept me wanting more:
> be it a way to limit the entries returned instead of opening a tree
> branch and having the whole application freeze, or an easy way to
> switch connections etc. etc.. All of this kept me going back to a
> Windows only client.
> 
> LDAP Studio is sleek, fast and responds to user input even when
> extracting LDIFs with records in the size of hundreds of thousands. It
> is intuitive to use and has a really nice look and feel to it.
> 
> It simply rocks so far\!\!\! (I do not want to puch my luck :-) but that
> is how it feels).
