# Kerby Issue tracking

Our project uses [JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/DIRKRB/), a Java EE based issue tracking and project management application.

Issues, bugs, and feature requests should be submitted to the following issue tracking system :


| Directory Sub-Project | JIRA key | Link to issue tracking system |
|:-:|:-:|---|
| Kerby | DIRKRB | [https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/DIRKRB](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/DIRKRB) |

Umbrella JIRA: it's tracked in the master JIRA DIRKRB-102(issues.apache.org/jira/browse/DIRKRB-102), and find tasks there.
