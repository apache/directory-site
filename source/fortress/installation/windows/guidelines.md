# Guidelines and Tips for first-time users


* In the document that follows, when you read \[version\] or \[platform\] substitute with current package info. For example - if the downloaded package version is 1.0.0 and platform is 'Windows', the instructions show fortressBuilder-\[platform\]-\[version\].jar your file name would be fortressBuilder-Windows-1.0.0.zip

* Does your target machine OS end with an X? Go to [README-QUICKSTART.html]

* The source code for this project is located in [FORTRESS_HOME\src folder].
