# Guidelines and Tips for first-time users


In the document that follows, when you read \[version\] or [platform] substitute with current package info. For example - if the downloaded package version is 1.0.0 and platform is 'Debian Silver i386', the instructions show fortressBuilder-\[platform\]-\[version\].jar your file name would be fortressBuilder-Debian-Silver-i386-1.0.0.zip

Is your target machine windows? Go to [README-QUICKSTART-WINDOWS](../windows/windows.html).

The source code for this project is located here ./src.
