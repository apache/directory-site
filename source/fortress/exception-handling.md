# Fortress Exception Handling

Fortress communicates errors to the caller via checked exceptions. At the highest level is the [SecurityException](https://directory.apache.org/fortress/gen-docs/latest/apidocs/org/apache/directory/fortress/core/SecurityException.html).

It is declared to be thrown by all APIs within the Fortress Manager interfaces.
The original exception thrown may be of this type or one of its extensions:
* [AuthorizationException](https://directory.apache.org/fortress/gen-docs/latest/apidocs/org/apache/directory/fortress/core/AuthorizationException.html) in the event user fails administrative permission check.
* [CfgException](https://directory.apache.org/fortress/gen-docs/latest/apidocs/org/apache/directory/fortress/core/CfgException.html) in the event the runtime cfg system fails.
* [CreateException](https://directory.apache.org/fortress/gen-docs/latest/apidocs/org/apache/directory/fortress/core/CreateException.html) in the event DAO cannot create entity.
* [FinderException](https://directory.apache.org/fortress/gen-docs/latest/apidocs/org/apache/directory/fortress/core/FinderException.html) in the event DAO cannot find the entity.
* [PasswordException](https://directory.apache.org/fortress/gen-docs/latest/apidocs/org/apache/directory/fortress/core/PasswordException.html) in the event user fails password checks or password policy exception occurs.
* [RemoveException](https://directory.apache.org/fortress/gen-docs/latest/apidocs/org/apache/directory/fortress/core/RemoveException.html) in the event DAO cannot remove entity.
* [RestException](https://directory.apache.org/fortress/gen-docs/latest/apidocs/org/apache/directory/fortress/core/RestException.html) during HTTP event failure.
* [UpdateException](https://directory.apache.org/fortress/gen-docs/latest/apidocs/org/apache/directory/fortress/core/UpdateException.html) in the event DAO cannot update entity.
* [ValidationException](https://directory.apache.org/fortress/gen-docs/latest/apidocs/org/apache/directory/fortress/core/ValidationException.html) in the event entity validation fails.

For some methods, e.g. AccessMgr.createSession, AccessMgr.authenticate, the caller may need to differentiate by one of the above subclasses, e.g. PasswordException, to facilitate password expiring condition or allow user to retry authentication after entering it incorrectly.
If specific exception processing is not required and differentiating conditions by SecurityException#errorId is acceptable, callers are allowed to catch (or throw) as type SecurityException.

All exceptions generated by Fortress will be set as an error code. These codes are declared in [GlobalErrIds](https://directory.apache.org/fortress/gen-docs/latest/apidocs/org/apache/directory/fortress/core/GlobalErrIds.html) and are also listed below:
