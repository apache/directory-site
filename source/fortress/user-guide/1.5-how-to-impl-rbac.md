# 1.5 - How to implement ANSI RBAC

* Learn using the SPEC
    
* Pick a technology stack you are comfortable with based on current knowledge, SLAs, data storage, and support requirements.

* Design a very simple RBAC data model.  Eight objects are all that is needed.
    * User, Role, Permission, Object, Operation, User-Role, Session, Constraints

* Design a simple RBAC software model. 
    * Top layer called a Manager and contains a stable public API that external apps may call.
        * Three managers, System, Admin, Review are all that is needed.
        * The implementation the manager interface contains must be able to be be swapped out for another complete RBAC system without impacting dependent apps.
        * External applications use RBAC Manager API to map to internal entitlement systems.
    * Middle layer for RBAC system is optional and may be used for processing fine-grained data validations rules
    * Bottom layer for accessing the actual data.
        * Implementation may be swapped for other back ends without impacting Manager.  
        * LDAP, JDBC, Hibernate, JAX-WS, JAX-RS other technologies may be used here to manage the data

* Don't ignore the Audit
    * View before and after images of the data

* Code first as a POC.  Start with the core - RBAC0.  Get it right first.

* Test driven development and automation key contributors to successful outcome.
    * Engage IT teams.
        * Analyze existing IT entitlements.  
        * Use established role mining techniques.  

* Map existing IT entitlements to RBAC system using established role engineering techniques

* Use parent roles as Business Roles and child roles as IT Roles.

* Deploy RBAC system into application environment using established standards.  Use declarative policy enforcement points like JEE security for coarse-grained, Spring for fine-grained.  

* Application teams own mapping between Business and IT roles.

* Model administrative controls on ARBAC.  More on ARBAC coming soon...
