# 1.3 - What ANSI RBAC is

There is more to RBAC than using a Role object during policy enforcement.

* ANSI INCITS 359-2001, [https://profsandhu.com/journals/tissec/ANSI+INCITS+359-2004.pdf](https://profsandhu.com/journals/tissec/ANSI+INCITS+359-2004.pdf) - The ANSI specification describes RBAC and provides functional specifications in Z-notation.

* <b>RBAC0</b> - Users, Roles, Permissions (Objects-Operations), Sessions - Form the Core of ANSI RBAC.  Role activation and Permissions mapped to Object->Operation pairing are key facets of the basic ANSI RBAC model.

* <b>RBAC1</b> - Hierarchical Roles - Encourages proper role engineering.  Parent roles are Business Roles while child roles map to IT Roles.  Role hierarchies should be many-to-many or multi-inheritance.

* <b>RBAC2</b> - Static Separation of Duties - Used to limit the privilege of users to within normal boundaries.  SSD constraints are applied at role assignment time.

* <b>RBAC3</b> - Dynamic Separation of Duties - Enforces constraints on what functions may used together at any point in time.  DSD constraints may be used to enforce strict controls during multi-step approval processes.  DSD constraints are applied at role activation time.

* Well defined APIs that can be shared across projects and application development teams.
    
* Well defined data model.  Easily created and replicated across the enterprise.
