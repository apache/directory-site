![ANSI RBAC Specification](images/ANSIRBAC-Spec_0.png)

Misnomers abound as to what constitutes a working Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system. With ANSI RBAC, Groups are not Roles and resource connections not Sessions. This paper explains what ANSI RBAC is and how it can be applied to existing problem domains. It dispels longstanding myths persistent within the enterprise. Additionally readers receive tips on how to implement their own successful RBAC program and where to go to get a fully compliant ANSI RBAC system that may be used as a reference implementation.
