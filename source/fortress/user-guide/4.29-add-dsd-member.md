# 4.29 - Add Dynamic Separation of Duty (DSD) Set Member
    
```java
SDSet addDsdRoleMember( SDSet ssdSet, Role role ) throws SecurityException;
```

This command adds a role to a named DSD set of roles. The cardinality associated with the role set remains unchanged.

The command is valid if and only if:

- The DSD role set exists.
- The role to be added is a member of the ROLES data set but not of a member of the DSD role set.
- The DSD constraint for the new role set is satisfied.

This method:
- Adds a member to an existing DSD set.
- Affects (runtime) role activations.

required parameters:
- SDSet#name - contains the name for the Set to be modified.
- Type of SD Set - 'DYNAMIC' (automatically set via this method).
- Role#name - of new set member.

Throws:
- SecurityException - thrown in the event of data validation or system error.
