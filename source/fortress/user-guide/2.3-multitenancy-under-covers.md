# Multitenancy under the covers

## Under the covers

The Fortress data design allows clients to share a single server instance because each has its own storage area set aside in the back end database.  This increases operational efficiency of the hosting service providerâ€™s data center without sacrificing data isolation on behalf of the clients who use it.
