# Testimonials

This page collects testimonies from **Apache Directory Server** users, and expose what they are using it for.
    
* The _openthinclient.org_ project uses **ADS** as an embedded directory server to store all kinds of configuration data.
	[http://openthinclient.org](http://openthinclient.org) is an open source thin client management solution allowing thin clients to boot from the network via using a single pure-java server.

* **Mitchell Robson**, founder of [nicefonts.com](https://nicefonts.com): "As a developer, I first discovered the power of Apache Directory when seeking an efficient solution for managing directory services. Built on **LDAP**, this open-source directory server integrates seamlessly with Java-based applications and offers an intuitive configuration interface through **Apache Directory Studio**. **Apache Directory**'s extensibility, performance, and security are standout features that keep me using it. With support for custom partition implementations, replication, and various authentication mechanisms, **Apache Directory** ensures high availability, fault tolerance, and security for mission-critical applications. It has become my top choice when I'm in need of a reliable and feature-rich directory service solution."
