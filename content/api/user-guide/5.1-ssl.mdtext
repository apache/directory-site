# 5.1 - SSL

**LDAP** supports **SSL**, it's called **LDAPS**, and it uses a dedicated port. As of today, and since 2000, **LDAPS** is deprecated and **StartTLS** should be used.

That being said, many servers accept **LDAPS**, and the Apache LDAP API supports it.

## How does it work ?

The **SSL** protocol ensures that data are transmitted encrypted, and guarantees that the data being received are valid. Nobody can capture those data and read them, assuming the ciphers being used are strong enough.

With **SSL**, a dialog between the client and the server occurs, and when both part agree on the cipher to use, then all subsequent data is encrypted. This dialog may include a mutual validation. 

## Protocols

There are many version that can be used, but the idea is to use tha most recent one, if the server supports it. In any case, as we depend on **Java**, we are also limited by the supported version on the client side. Here are all the existing version, and their status :

| SSLversion | Java 7 Client | Java 7 Server | Java 8 Client | Java 8 Server |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2.0 | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A |
| 3.0 | Disabled | Disabled | N/A | N/A |
| 3.1 (aka TLSv1) | **Enabled** | **Enabled** | **Enabled** | **Enabled** |
| 3.2 (aka TLSv1.1 | Disabled | **Enabled** | **Enabled** | **Enabled** |
| 3.3 (aka TLSv1.2) | Disabled | **Enabled** | **Enabled** | **Enabled** |

(_Disabled_ mean it's not active by default, and must be activated explicitely).

The default is for Java to pick the one that fits, assuming that it will always start with the newest version (**TLSv1.2**).

Still, you can enforce the version if needed.

## A quick primer

Here is all what you need to get a **LDAPS** connection established with a server :

        try ( LdapConnection connection = new LdapNetworkConnection( "server-name", 636, true ) )
        {
            connection.bind( "uid=admin,ou=system", "secret" );

            assertTrue( connection.isAuthenticated() );
        }

This is as simple as that ! The **636* port is the default **LDAPS** port for standard **LDAP** servers, when running as **root**, and for **ApacheDS** you will have to pick **10636**. The **true** flag is set to secure the connection. You don't need to close the connection, it will be done automatically when exiting the try{...} block.

By default, the selected protocol is **TLS**, and we wont verify the server's certificate.
