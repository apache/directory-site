# 2 - Basic LDAP API usage (...)

We provide three different set of methods to send requests to the **LDAP** server :
* A first set which is the simplest, where the methods don't return a response, except the _search_ and _compare_ methods
* A second set, for advanced users, giving full control to the user
* A third set allowing the user to send asynchronous requests.

The first set of methods covers Bind, Add, Delete, Modify, Rename, Move, and Unbind operations

The second set covers MoveAndRename, Compare, Extended, controls.

the third set covers the same methods, but ran in asynchronous mode.
