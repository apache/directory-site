# 2.6 - Modifying entries

There are several ways an entry can be modified. Mainly, it's about adding or deleting an attribute, or it's about modifying the values associated with an existing attribute. We will expose the methods that can be used for those two main cases.

It's important to understand that you can apply many modifications to a single entry, too. All those modifications will be effective as if the entry was modified as a whole, ie the modifications will be fully applied, or none of the modifications will be applied (for instance, if teh server crashes while applying the modifications, it's guaranteed that the entry will remain consistent, and if one of the modifications is invalid, then no modification will be applied)

## How it works ?

As we may have more than one modification, we use an intermediate class to carry the elements to be changed : a _Modification_ instance. You create such an instance this way :

    :::Java
    Modification addedGivenName = new DefaultModification( ModificationOperation.ADD_ATTRIBUTE, "givenName", "John", "Peter" );

Here, we just have created an instance that will add the _giveName_ attribute, with the "John" and "Peter" values (the _givenName_ attribute can have more than one value).

There are three different kind of modification :

* ModificationOperation.ADD_ATTRIBUTE : add an attribute and values to an entry
* ModificationOperation.REMOVE_ATTRIBUTE : remove an attribute and values from an entry
* ModificationOperation.REPLACE_ATTRIBUTE : replace some existing values from an entry

## Adding or removing full attributes

The two following operations are dealing with complete addition or removal of attributes.

### Adding new attributes

First of all, let's see haw we proceed when it comes to add an attribute. You need to know the entry you want to modify, which means you have its Dn. Then, you have to create the _Modification_ instance that will be applied on the entry. Here is the code that is used to add a _givenName_ attribute to an existing entry :

    :::Java
    ...
    Modification addedGivenName = new DefaultModification( ModificationOperation.ADD_ATTRIBUTE, "givenName",
        "John", "Peter" );

    connection.modify( "uid=Doe,dc=acme,dc=com", addedGivenName );
    ...

#### Adding more than one attribute

What if you want to apply more than one modification to the entry ?

Easy : create more than one _Modification_ instances, and add them when calling the _modify_ method :

    :::Java
    ...
    Modification addedGivenName = new DefaultModification( ModificationOperation.ADD_ATTRIBUTE, "givenName",
        "John", "Peter" );
    Modification addedInitials = new DefaultModification( ModificationOperation.ADD_ATTRIBUTE, "initials",
        "JD" );

    connection.modify( "uid=Doe,dc=acme,dc=com", addedGivenName, addedInitials );
    ...

You can add as many _Modification_ instances as needed.

#### Errors

If you try to add an attribute that already exists, you will get an error, like this one :

    :::Java
    ...
    Modification addedGivenName = new DefaultModification( ModificationOperation.ADD_ATTRIBUTE, "givenName",
        "John", "Peter" );
    Modification addedUid = new DefaultModification( ModificationOperation.ADD_ATTRIBUTE, "uid",
        "Ted" );

    connection.modify( "uid=Doe,dc=acme,dc=com", addedGivenName, addedUid );
    ...

results in : 

    :::Java
    org.apache.directory.api.ldap.model.exception.LdapAttributeInUseException: ATTRIBUTE_OR_VALUE_EXISTS: failed for MessageType : MODIFY_REQUEST
    Message ID : 3
        Modify Request
            Object : 'uid=Doe,dc=acme,dc=com'
                Modification[0]
                    Operation :  add
                    Modification
                        givenName: John
                        givenName: Peter            
                Modification[1]
                    Operation :  add
                    Modification
                        uid: Ted
    org.apache.directory.api.ldap.model.message.ModifyRequestImpl@13532916: ERR_54 Cannot add a value which is already present : admin
    at org.apache.directory.api.ldap.model.message.ResultCodeEnum.processResponse(ResultCodeEnum.java:2064)
    at org.apache.directory.ldap.client.api.LdapNetworkConnection.modify(LdapNetworkConnection.java:2300)
    at org.apache.directory.ldap.client.api.LdapNetworkConnection.modify(LdapNetworkConnection.java:2309)
    ...

Here, we have tried to add the _uid_ attribute which already exists, and the error trace says so.

Anothe potential error you can get is when you try to add an attribute that is not allowed in an entry. This can be because the Entry ObjectClass does not allow such an attribute to be added, or because the server forbid you to modify the entry, due to the ACL that rules this entry.

Last, not least, but this is quite obvious, the entry *must* exist !

### Removing an attribute

Removing an attribute is actually a bit simpler than adding an attribute, as you don't have to specify the values of the attribute to remove. Here is an exemple where we will remove the _giveName_ attrinute from an entry :


    :::Java
    ...
    Modification deletedGivenName = new DefaultModification( ModificationOperation.REMOVE_ATTRIBUTE, "givenName" );

    connection.modify( "uid=Doe,dc=acme,dc=com", adeletedivenName );
    ...

Here, we have created a modification, specifying that the _givenName_ attribute has to be removed, and we applied the modification on the entry.

Again, you can delete more than one attribute from an entry, it's just a matter of creating more than one _Modification_ instances and applying them to the entry.

#### Errors

If you try to delete an attribute that does not exist in the entry, you will get this error :

    :::Java
    org.apache.directory.api.ldap.model.exception.LdapNoSuchAttributeException: NO_SUCH_ATTRIBUTE: failed for MessageType : MODIFY_REQUEST
    Message ID : 3
        Modify Request
            Object : 'uid=admin,ou=system'
                Modification[0]
                    Operation :  delete
                    Modification
                        givenName: (null)
    org.apache.directory.api.ldap.model.message.ModifyRequestImpl@fbe6f598: ERR_55 Trying to remove an non-existant attribute:

        at org.apache.directory.shared.client.api.operations.ClientModifyRequestTest.testModifyRemoveAttribute(ClientModifyRequestTest.java:302)


Here, the entry does not contain the _givenName_ attribute.

Anothe potential error you can get is when you try to remove an attribute which is a mandatory attribute, per the entry's ObjectClass constraints.

Otherwise, the server might forbid you to modify the entry, due to the ACL that rules this entry.

Last, not least, but this is quite obvious, the entry *must* exist !
