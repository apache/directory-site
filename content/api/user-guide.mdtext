This documentation is about the newly LDAP API developped at the Apache Software Foundation. We expect this API will be a replacement for all the ancient API ([jLdap](http://www.openldap.org/jldap/), [Mozilla LDAP SDK](http://www.mozilla.org/directory/) and [JNDI](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/jndi/index.html)).

## About this guide

Getting started. Learn how to use the LDAP API, connect to various LDAP server, manipulate the data within your directory. 

### Audience

This guide is primarily for people new to the LDAP API. If you plan to use the API as is, maybe even for your first LDAP experience, you'll (hopefully) find all information necessary to do so. Only basic tasks are covered. Learn more about the options you have (and many other things) in the [Advanced User's Guide].
