# 4.1 - ASN/1 TLV

## What are TLVs ?

The acronym **TLV** stands for **T**ag, **L**ength and **V**alue. It's a way to encode a piece of information with a type, a length followed by the information itself. Three points must be known:

* The **Value** part may contents other **TLV**s. One can see **TLV**s as C structures, that can contain sub-structures.
* The **Value** may not exist, and in this case the **Length** will be 0.
* The **Length** part may not give the **Value** length: it is called an _indefinite Length_. In this - not so frequent - case, the **Value** must end with a specific terminator.

### A quick sample

Let's begin with a simple example, without too many explanations. This is the **PDU** (**P**acket **D**ata **U**nit) of a LDAP _BindRequest_:

![TLV](images/TLVs.png)

We can see in this picture that you have what is called a first level **TLV**. It encapsulates other **TLV**s. It's basically a stream of bytes.


### Type

Each **Type** contains information about the **Value** part of the **TLV**. It tells if the **Value** is a primitive or a constructed one, which type of primitive is the value, gives some contextual information. A **Type** can be coded on more than one byte. The first 3 bits give some contextual information about the **Type**, and the 5 following bits are either a label or the beginning of a multi-bytes label.

* Labels are numbers in [0..30], and they represent a specific **ASN/1** element in the protocol description, like _CompareRequest ::= [APPLICATION 14] _ (here, the label is 14). 
* If the label is 31, then more than one byte is used to encode the **Type**. In this case, we use the following bytes to compute the label, where each byte which high bit is one will be followed by another byte. 

We limit the label to 2,097,151 as we encode the **Type** in one Java int : 

    :::
    b1 xxx[1-1111], b2 1[111-1111], b3 1[111-1111], b4 0[111-1111]
    ->
    [111-1111][111-1111][111-1111] 
    ->
    0001-1111 1111-1111 1111-1111
    ->
    0x1FFFFF
    -> 
    2,097,151

In **LDAP** or **Kerberos**, no label is higher than 30, so we always use 1 byte **Type**s.

Other interesting information that we need to grab from a *Type* are stored in the two first bits (bit 7 and 6), and in the third bit (bit 5). The first two bits describe the class, the third tells if the **TLV** is a **primitive** (b5 = 0) or a **constructed** **TLV** (b5 = 1).


### Length

**Length** gives the number of bytes of the **Value**, and nothing else. So the total length of a **TLV** will be:

    :::
    TLV length = Tag length + Length length + Value length, 

where the **Value** length is stored in the **Length** element.

The **Length** may be 0, which means that there is no value following.

How is **Length** encoded? A **Value** may be from 0 to N bytes long, with N < (256 ^ 126) - 1. This limit is purely hypothetic, of course. If we have to deal with huge objects like pictures or movies, their length will not exceed a few MBytes or a few GBytes

Typically, we will find five kind of **Length**s :

* zero length values;
* values with a length less than 128 bytes
* values with a length between 128 and 256 ^ 4 bytes long (an int will be able to hold 4 bytes);
* values above 256 ^ 4 bytes long
* values which length is not defined by the **Length** element.

The last type of Length could occurs if the sender does not know the length of the value while it is sending it. **LDAP** protocol does not allow those kind of values, which are dangerous because you need to read the full **Value** to know its length.

The fourth type could also be ignored (4 GBytes is quite a huge size for an LDAP element ...), so we can decide that we won't accept those **Values**. It seems reasonable.

As the **Length** can be stored in more than one byte, we have to take care of fragmented **PDU** : we may receive only the first bytes, and have to wait for the rest to be received. The idea is to freeze and start again when we receive some more data.

In any case, if the first byte is > 0x7F, that means it's a multi-bytes length, and we have to process the following bytesto get the real length. In this case, the first byte contains teh number of expected following bytes. Typically :

    :::
    0x74 -> 116
    0x82 0x02 0x84 : 2 bytes, length = 2 * 16 + 132 -> 164
    0x81 0x84 : 1 byte, length = 132


### Value

**Value** carries the 'meat' of a **TLV**. Depending on the **Type**, it's either a primitive value, or a constructed one (which means it contains a **TLV** or a set of **TLV**s). Remember that bit 5 of the **Type** tells if the **Value is _primitive_ ( b5 == 0) or _constructed (b5 == 1).

* If we have a _primitive_ **Value**, we have to read **Length** byte and we are done
** If we have a _constructed_ **Value**, we have to process it as one or more **TLV**.

## TLV processing

In the **API**, the **TLV** processing is done in the _Asn1Decoder_ class, and more specifically by the _decode( ByteBuffer stream, Asn1Container container )_ method, which takes a ByteBuffer as input, and feed a container as a result. 

The important thing to understand is that this method can be called repetively, until a message is fully decoded, as soon as we feed it with some new _ByteBuffer_. The _Container_ instance will contain the result, as soon as its state has switched to **PDU_DECODED**.

While processing a **TLV**, when we are done with the **Value** part, the decoder will check if any action is to be executed. The action is associated to the grammar in use, which is stored in the container. Here is the part that call the action, in the _Asn1Decoder.treatTLVDoneState()_ method :

    :::java
    private boolean treatTLVDoneState( ByteBuffer stream, Asn1Container container ) throws DecoderException
    {
        // First, we have to execute the associated action
        container.getGrammar().executeAction( container );
        ...

So the _Container_ must contain the grammar, and the current state. We may not have any action to execute, either because none is associated with the current transition or because we are at the end of the message.

### TLV implementation

The **TLV** class stores the **Type**, **Length** and **Value**, plus some extra information, like a unique _id_, a reference to its parent's **TLV** and the expected length when the included **Value** is a set of **TLV**.

![TLV/BerValue](images/tlv-bervalue.png)

You won't have tp manipulate **TLV** frequently, except in the actions, where you might fetch its *Length** and **Value** content, using _getLength()_ and _getValue().getData()_ methods respectively.

### Action

This is quite a simple class and hierarchy :

![GrammarAction](images/grammar-action.png)

As we can see, each **Action** has a name (this is only used for debug purpose) and a _action(Asn1Container)_ method, which does what it needs. The _Asn1Container_ parameter gives access to the data through the _Asn1Container.getCurrentTLV().getValue().getData()_ method, and to the message being processed.

At this point, an example would be useful.

## Example

Let say we want to implement a decoder for the following message :

    :::
    EntryChangeNotification ::= SEQUENCE
    {
        changeType ENUMERATED
        {
            add             (1),
            delete          (2),
            modify          (4),
            modDN           (8)
        },
        previousDN   LDAPDN OPTIONAL,     -- modifyDN ops. only
        changeNumber INTEGER OPTIONAL     -- if supported
    }

You don't need to know anything about this message, what is important is how we will decode it.

The first thing we need to create is an interface and a implementation for the Java object that will represent the **EntryChange** object.

Here is the interface (note that it's a _Control_, but it's a irrelevant information here) :

    :::Java
    public interface EntryChange extends Control
    {
        /** No defined change number */ 
        int UNDEFINED_CHANGE_NUMBER = -1;

        /** The EntryChange control */
        String OID = "2.16.840.1.113730.3.4.7";


        /**
         * @return The ChangeType
         */
        ChangeType getChangeType();


        /**
         * Set the ChangeType
         *
         * @param changeType Add, Delete; Modify or ModifyDN
         */
        void setChangeType( ChangeType changeType );


        /**
         * @return The previous DN
         */
        Dn getPreviousDn();


        /**
         * Sets the previous DN
         * 
         * @param previousDn The previous DN
         */
        void setPreviousDn( Dn previousDn );


        /**
         * @return The change number
         */
        long getChangeNumber();


        /**
         * Sets the ChangeNumber
         * 
         * @param changeNumber The ChanegNumber
         */
        void setChangeNumber( long changeNumber );
    }

What is important is that we declare all the setters and getters for the object fields that matter : _changeType_, _previousDN_ and _changeNumber_

The implementation is not really complex :

    :::Java
    /**
     * A simple implementation of the EntryChange response control.
     *
     * @author <a href="mailto:dev@directory.apache.org">Apache Directory Project</a>
     */
    public class EntryChangeImpl extends AbstractControl implements EntryChange
    {
        /** The changeType */
        private ChangeType changeType = ChangeType.ADD;

        private long changeNumber = UNDEFINED_CHANGE_NUMBER;

        /** The previous Dn */
        private Dn previousDn = null;


        /**
         *
         * Creates a new instance of EntryChangeControl.
         *
         */
        public EntryChangeImpl()
        {
            super( OID );
        }


        /**
         * {@inheritDoc}
         */
        @Override
        public ChangeType getChangeType()
        {
            return changeType;
        }


        /**
         * {@inheritDoc}
         */
        @Override
        public void setChangeType( ChangeType changeType )
        {
            this.changeType = changeType;
        }


        /**
         * {@inheritDoc}
         */
        @Override
        public Dn getPreviousDn()
        {
            return previousDn;
        }


        /**
         * {@inheritDoc}
         */
        @Override
        public void setPreviousDn( Dn previousDn )
        {
            this.previousDn = previousDn;
        }


        /**
         * {@inheritDoc}
         */
        @Override
        public long getChangeNumber()
        {
            return changeNumber;
        }


        /**
         * {@inheritDoc}
         */
        @Override
        public void setChangeNumber( long changeNumber )
        {
            this.changeNumber = changeNumber;
        }


        /**
         * @see Object#hashCode()
         */
        @Override
        public int hashCode()
        {
            int h = super.hashCode();

            h = h * 37 + ( int ) changeNumber;
            h = h * 37 + ( changeType == null ? 0 : changeType.hashCode() );
            h = h * 37 + ( previousDn == null ? 0 : previousDn.hashCode() );

            return h;
        }


        /**
         * {@inheritDoc}
         */
        @Override
        public boolean equals( Object o )
        {
            if ( !super.equals( o ) )
            {
                return false;
            }

            EntryChange otherControl = ( EntryChange ) o;

            return ( changeNumber == otherControl.getChangeNumber() ) && ( changeType == otherControl.getChangeType() )
                && ( previousDn.equals( otherControl.getPreviousDn() ) );
        }


        /**
         * Return a String representing this EntryChangeControl.
         */
        @Override
        public String toString()
        {
            StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();

            sb.append( "    Entry Change Control\n" );
            sb.append( "        oid : " ).append( getOid() ).append( '\n' );
            sb.append( "        critical : " ).append( isCritical() ).append( '\n' );
            sb.append( "        changeType   : '" ).append( changeType ).append( "'\n" );
            sb.append( "        previousDN   : '" ).append( previousDn ).append( "'\n" );

            if ( changeNumber == UNDEFINED_CHANGE_NUMBER )
            {
                sb.append( "        changeNumber : '" ).append( "UNDEFINED" ).append( "'\n" );
            }
            else
            {
                sb.append( "        changeNumber : '" ).append( changeNumber ).append( "'\n" );
            }

            return sb.toString();
        }
    }

This is pretty much trivial.
