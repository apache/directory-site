# 1 - Introduction

This Developer Guide teaches developers about the inner logic of the API. It can be useful to those interested in the project, giving them some clues about how it all works and its design, and also to those who want to extend the **LDAP API* by adding _Controls_, _Extended Operations_, or schema elements like _SyntaxCheckers_, _Comparators_, etc.
