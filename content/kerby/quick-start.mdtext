The Quick Start guides show you how to do base install of Kerby:

## 1. How to play with the standalone KDC:

The distribution of Kerby.

### To run with a standalone kdc server, kinit and kadmin

* Generate libraries for distribution:

    $ mvn package -Pdist

* Run kadmin to add principals:

    $ sh kerby-dist/tool-dist/bin/kadmin.sh [server-conf-dir]

  In kadmin, you can type "?" for help. For now, the kadmin only supports to add principals to json-backend. (Working in progress).

* Start kerby-kdc-server:

    $ sh kerby-dist/kdc-dist/bin/start-kdc.sh Â–start [server-conf-dir] [work-dir]

* Run kinit:

    $ sh kerby-dist/tool-dist/bin/kinit.sh [principal-name]

  If you don't specify [server-conf-dir] in step 2 or 3, it will be set as /etc/kerby. In [server-conf-dir], there should be kdc.conf, backend.conf. And in /etc/, there should be krb5.conf.

An example of kdc.conf:

    [kdcdefaults]
        kdc_host = localhost
        kdc_tcp_port = 8015
        kdc_realm = TEST.COM

An example of json backend backend.conf:

    kdc_identity_backend = org.apache.kerby.kerberos.kdc.identitybackend.JsonIdentityBackend
    backend.json.file = /tmp/kerby/jsonbackend

An example of zookeeper backend backend.conf:

    kdc_identity_backend = org.apache.kerby.kerberos.kdc.identitybackend.ZookeeperIdentityBackend
    data_dir = /tmp/kerby/zookeeper/data
    data_log_dir = /tmp/kerby/zookeeper/datalog

An example of krb5.conf:

    [libdefaults]
        kdc_realm=TEST.COM
