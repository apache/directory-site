## Project Vision

<a href="http://directory.apache.org/community%26resources/ldap-renaissance.html" title="Architecting the Modern LDAP Renaissance" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">here</a>
We strive to increase LDAP awareness, comfort and adoption to bring forth what we call the Modern LDAP Renaissance. Learn more about our vision [here](http://directory.apache.org/community%26resources/ldap-renaissance.html).

## Directory Sub-Projects

The Apache Directory Project provides directory solutions entirely written in Java. These include a directory server, which has been certified as LDAP v3 compliant by the Open Group (ApacheDS), and Eclipse-based directory tools (Apache Directory Studio).

			</div>
			<div class="separator">&nbsp;</div>
			ApacheDS is an extensible and embeddable directory server entirely written in Java, which has been certified LDAPv3 compatible by the Open Group. Besides LDAP it supports Kerberos 5 and the Change Password Protocol. It has been designed to introduce triggers, stored procedures, queues and views to the world of LDAP which has lacked these rich constructs.

			Apache Directory Studio is a complete directory tooling platform intended to be used with any LDAP server however it is particularly designed for use with ApacheDS. It is an Eclipse RCP application, composed of several Eclipse (OSGi) plugins, that can be easily upgraded with additional ones. These plugins can even run within Eclipse itself.
