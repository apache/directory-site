# 1 - What is Kerberos ?

**Kerberos** is the result of an effort by the MIT, known as **Project Athena**. It started in May 1983, and resulted in many internal version at the MIT, and finally, **Kerberos V4** was openly released on January 1989. **Kerberos V5* is available since 1993.

**Kerberos** is a computer network authentication protocol, which provides a secure, SSO, trusted third-party mutual authentication service.

* It's secure because the user's password is never transmitted over the wire. **Kerberos** uses **Tickets** which are negociated with the server, with a limited time to live.

* It a SSO system as a ticket can be used by all the services for its duration. The services can fully trust those tickets.

* It's a trusted third party as all the users and services are managed by the **Kerberos** server. 

* It's a mutual authentication system that guarantees not only that the user is who he is pretending to be, but because each user has the guarantee that the services he accesses to are the expected services.

**Kerberos** is widely used in the **Microsoft&trade;** world, as all the authentications on **Microsoft&trade;** are done through this protocol.
