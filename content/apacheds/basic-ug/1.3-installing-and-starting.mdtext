# 1.3 - Installing and starting the server

This section describes how ApacheDS can be installed and started on different platforms.

[TOC]

## Prerequisites

* **Java 5.0** (at least). We recommend using [Sun's JDK](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) , but the server has also been successfully tested with JRockit 5.0 and with IBM Java 5.0. The server also works well with Java version 6 and 7. 

You can check your java installation with:

	java -version

this should response something like:

	java version "1.5.0_06"
	Java(TM) 2 Runtime Environment, Standard Edition (build 1.5.0_06-b05)
	Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM (build 1.5.0_06-b05, mixed mode)

* using Linux: you must have a X11 graphical interface
* **384 MB RAM** for the JVM. That's the default setting, how to change that is described [here|1.4. Basic configuration tasks#MemoryAllocation]


## Download a server installer

We provide native installers for several platforms:

* Windows (exe)
* Mac OS X (dmg)
* Solaris x86 and SPARC (pkg)
* Debian package (deb)
* RPM package (rpm)
* Linux Binary (bin)

Additional we provide an zip and tar.gz archive suitable for any platform.

You can download them from [here](http://http://directory.apache.org/apacheds/2.0/downloads.html).

An option for people familiar with tools like Subversion and Maven is to built the server from the sources on their own. This is described  [here](http://directory.apache.org/community&resources/sources.html).


# Installation on Windows

Installing can be easily done using the Windows installer. Its interface and functionality is similar to other wizard based installers.

To install the ApacheDS as Windows service you need *Administrator* privileges.

### Starting and stopping the server

The server can be started and stopped with Windows Services manager (*Control Panel > Administrative Tools > Services*). You must be admin to do this.

From there, you can easily start, stop and restart Apache DS.

## Installation on Mac OS X

To install Apache DS on Mac OS X, simply open the downloaded DMG file and then the "Apache Directory Server Installer.pkg" in it.

<CENTER>

</CENTER>

From there, you will be guided to install Apache DS on your system.

### Starting and stopping the server

On Mac OS X, Apache DS is installed as a [launchd](http://developer.apple.com/macosx/launchd.html) service and is loaded at startup time (and upon successful installation).

You can stop the server by unloading the launchd service with the following command line:

	sudo launchctl unload /Library/LaunchDaemons/org.apache.directory.server.plist

You can start the server by loading the launchd service with the following command line:

	sudo launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/org.apache.directory.server.plist

If you want to disable the automatic startup of the server, just modify the plist file :

       <key>Disabled</key>
       <false/>

should be replaced by

       <key>Disabled</key>
       <true/>

Once the server has been installed, you can start it with :

  sudo launchctl start org.apache.directory.server

and stop it with :

  sudo launchctl stop org.apache.directory.server


## Installation on Linux and Solaris

The installation for different installers is described on the [Apache Directory Server 2.0 Downloads](http://directory.apache.org/apacheds/downloads.html) page.
