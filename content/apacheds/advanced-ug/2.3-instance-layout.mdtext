# 2.3 - Instance Layout

Note that the installation will differ with the target OS. We currently support :

* ![debian](images/debian.png)[2.3.1 - Debian instance Layout](2.3.1-debian-instance-layout.html)
* ![RPM](images/rpm.png)[2.3.2 - RPM instance Layout](2.3.2-rpm-instance-layout.html)
* ![MacOSX](images/mac.png)[2.3.3 - MacOSX instance Layout](2.3.3-macosx-instance-layout.html)
* ![Windows](images/windows.png)[2.3.4 - Windows instance Layout](2.3.4-windows-instance-layout.html)
* [2.3.5 - Generic instance Layout](2.3.5-generic-instance-layout.html)

When we start a server, after having installed it, it creates some other directories where the data will be stored. Here is a list of those data :

* the partitions data
* the logs
* the cache files
* the replication data (if setup)
* the run files


## Created directories

The following directories are created on your disk :

installation directory/
    |
    +-- conf/
    |    |
    |    +-- config.ldif
    |    |
    |    +-- wrapper.conf
    |    |
    |    +-- log4j.properties
    |
    +-- log/

    |   [+-- journal.ldif]
    |    |
    |    +-- <log file>
    |
    +-- partitions/
