# 4.1.2 - SASL Authentication

**SASL** authentication is based on a standard described in [RFC 4422](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4422.txt). **SASL** means **S**imple **A**uthentication and **S**ecurity **L**ayer.

It extends the Simple authentication, by allowing the LDAP server to authenticate the user by various mechanisms.

The **SASL* Authentication is used when a simple user/password authentication is not enough. Many other systems exist, and may take many parameters to authenticate a user. With **SASL**, a challenge/response system is used to get the needed information from the client, up to the point the authentication is either successful or fails.
