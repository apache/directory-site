## ApacheDS 2.0.0-M11 released _posted on March 3rd, 2013_

The Apache Directory team is pleased to announce the release of ApacheDS 2.0.0-M11, the eleventh milestone towards a 2.0 version.

ApacheDS is an extensible and embeddable directory server entirely written in Java, which has been certified LDAPv3 compatible by the Open Group. Besides LDAP it supports Kerberos 5 and the Change Password Protocol. It has been designed to introduce triggers, stored procedures, queues and views to the world of LDAP which has lacked these rich constructs.

Here is the release note for Apache Directory ApacheDS 2.0.0-M11:

  * [DIRSERVER-1281](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/DIRSERVER-1281) - StreamCorruptedException after brutal shutdown

  * [DIRSERVER-1803](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/DIRSERVER-1803) - When the SimpleAuthenticator is disabled, and the auth level is set to SIMPLE, we can bind freely
  * [DIRSERVER-1804](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/DIRSERVER-1804) - [patch] Fix ApacheDS code to allow control and reduce number of outputted logs
  * [DIRSERVER-1805](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/DIRSERVER-1805) - The replication janitor thread is not stopped correctly when teh server is stopped
