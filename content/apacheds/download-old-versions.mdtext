<DIV class="note" markdown="1">
We encourage you to verify the integrity of the downloaded file using:

* the ASC file (OpenPGP compatible signature) with the [KEYS](http://www.apache.org/dist/directory/KEYS) file (code signing keys used to sign the product)
* the MD5 file (checksum).
</DIV>

## Verify the integrity of the file

The PGP signatures can be verified using PGP or GPG. First download the [keys](http://www.apache.org/dist/directory/KEYS) file as well as the asc signature file for the relevant distribution. Then verify the signatures using:

	$ pgpk -a KEYS
	$ pgpv apache_1.3.24.tar.gz.asc

or

	$ pgp -ka KEYS
	$ pgp apache_1.3.24.tar.gz.asc

or

	$ gpg --import KEYS
	$ gpg --verify apache_1.3.24.tar.gz.asc

 

Alternatively, you can verify the MD5 signature on the files. A unix program called md5 or md5sum is included in many unix distributions. It is also available as part of [GNU Textutils](http://www.gnu.org/software/textutils/textutils.html). Windows users can get binary md5 programs from [here](http://www.fourmilab.ch/md5/), [here](http://www.pc-tools.net/win32/freeware/console/], or [here|http://www.slavasoft.com/fsum/).
