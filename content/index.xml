      <description>Mavibot initialization The very first step when using Mavibot is to initialize it. That means creating the database that will contain all the data (we use only one file for that).
This is done with a simple call, with one or 3 parameters:
RecordManager recordManager1 = new RecordManager( &amp;#34;MyData.db&amp;#34; ); // or  RecordManager recordManager2 = new RecordManager( &amp;#34;MyData.db&amp;#34;, 512, 1024 ); The first method just require that you name the file that will contain the data (&amp;ldquo;MyData.</description>

      <description>1.1 - ANSI RBAC Explained Misnomers abound as to what constitutes a working Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system. With ANSI RBAC, Groups are not Roles and resource connections not Sessions. This paper explains what ANSI RBAC is and how it can be applied to existing problem domains. It dispels longstanding myths persistent within the enterprise. Additionally readers receive tips on how to implement their own successful RBAC program and where to go to get a fully compliant ANSI RBAC system that may be used as a reference implementation.</description>

      <guid>https://directory.apache.org/mavibot/user-guide/1.1-btree-basics.html</guid>
      <description>1.1 - B-tree Basics B-tree was invented back in 1971 by Bayer and McCreight (the B does not mean anything known, speculations are that it comes either form the B of Bayer or from Boing they were working for back then). It was an extension to binary search tree, which was just able to store 2 elements per page.
A B-tree is a &amp;ldquo;tree data structure that keeps data sorted and allows searches, sequential access, insertions, and deletions in logarithmic time.</description>

      <guid>https://directory.apache.org/api/user-guide/1.1-java-and-ldap.html</guid>
      <description>1.1 - Java and LDAP Most developers will at some point need to learn how to communicate with an LDAP server. It should be a very simple technology to use but isn&amp;rsquo;t because many aspects are not well known.
Java is one of the most commonly used languages in the enterprise. Some call it the new Cobol!
These facts mean it&amp;rsquo;s necessary to communicate over LDAP using Java. This is why a convenient API is necessary, so we created this API to fill the necessary gaps.</description>

      <description>1.1 - What Apache Directory Server is This section describes what Apache Directory Server (abbreviated ApacheDS) is, and where it comes from.
 System vision  Architectural overview   Origin and Motives Resources   System vision ApacheDS 2.0 is an embeddable, extendable, standards compliant, modern LDAP server written entirely in Java, and available under the Apache Software License. Other network protocols like Kerberos and NTP are supported as well (and even more may be added), but basically (and especially for this introduction guide) ApacheDS is an LDAP server.</description>

      <description>1.1.1 - Realms A Realm is associated with a Kerberos administrative domain. In other words, it covers everything the Kerberos server manages :
 Users Services  Note that a Kerberos Server manages one Realm only, a Realm can be managed by more than one Kerberos server : this is mandatory to avoid a single point of failure, if a Kerberos server halts for any reason.
Realm name In order to distinguish the Realms, we give them a unique name.</description>

      <guid>https://directory.apache.org/apacheds/kerberos-ug/1.1.2-principals.html</guid>
      <description>1.1.2 - Principals The Kerberos Principal is any entity to which the server can assign a Ticket. Typically, we can think of three kinds of Principals :
* Users * Services * Hosts  Each Principal is unique in the Kerberos database. This is the way we identify the entity.
A Kerberos Principal is a combination of three parts :
* the name (the primary) * an optional instance * the realm they are associated with  The optional instance is used to provide more than one role to an entity, without having to create N Principals for a single user (an administrator is also a normal user, and it&amp;rsquo;s good to qualify the user by adding his admin qualificiation in one Principal to create a new and easy to remember Principal)</description>

      <guid>https://directory.apache.org/apacheds/kerberos-ug/1.1.3-keys.html</guid>
      <description>1.1.3 - Keys The Kerberos server generates keys based on the password we provide. Those keys are stored in the server and used to encrypt and decrypt the data being exchanged with the client.
The Key is computed using either the user&amp;rsquo;s password or a random value, and is salted with the realm.
Using the realm as the salt offers a level of protection : if one&#39;s key is broken on a realm, that does not mean the password is compromised.</description>

      <guid>https://directory.apache.org/apacheds/kerberos-ug/1.1.4-kdc.html</guid>
      <description>1.1.4 - KDC (Key Distribution Center) The KDC contains three components :
 an Authentication Service a Ticket Granting Service a database (ApacheDS)  The KDC role is to authenticate users and distribute tickets based on the information stored in its database.
The Apache Kerberos Server contains all these three components and hence is a KDC.
We could allow the **Kerberos Server** to manage more than one **KDC**, but this is not currently possible.</description>

      <guid>https://directory.apache.org/apacheds/kerberos-ug/1.1.5-database.html</guid>
      <description>1.1.5 - Database This is the place where all the private keys are stored. It is very common to store all the keys in an LDAP server, even more natural when the Kerberos server is a part of an existing LDAP server, like *Apache Directory Server !
When Apache Directory Server was started, it was also thought as a repository for Kerberos keys, so we just had to develop the logic to manage those keys, and the Kerberos protocol.</description>

      <guid>https://directory.apache.org/apacheds/kerberos-ug/1.1.6-as.html</guid>
      <description>1.1.6 - AS (Authentication Server) One of the two server components of a Kerberos server is the Authentication Server, which authenticates clients, and issues tickets (TGT, or Ticket Granting Ticket) that the user can send to the TGS to get a service ticket.
The TGT, or Ticket Granting Ticket, is a ticket that a client can use to get a service ticket. In fact, the authentication server considers the TGS as just another service, and generates a ticket for the user to access this service.</description>

      <guid>https://directory.apache.org/apacheds/kerberos-ug/1.1.7-tgs.html</guid>
      <description>1.1.7 - TGS (Ticket Granting Server) The second major service is the Ticket Granting Server, which is the service that delivers tickets for all the managed services to the users.
A client can access to this service fater having been authenticated - ie, after having received a ticket allowing it to access the TGS from the AS -.
At this point, all the exchanges are encrypted using the user session key.</description>

      <description>1.1.8 - Tickets All the kerberos system is based on the dstribution of tickets.
A Ticket is an encrypted data generated by the Kerberos Server and used by a service. It gives the right for a user to access a service, assuming the service can decrypt the ticket.
It also contains many other fields, like the ticket&amp;rsquo;s expiration date, for instance.
What&amp;rsquo;s inside a Ticket ? Here are the information that can be found in a ticket.</description>

      <description>1.2 - LDAP in a few words LDAP is not a new technlology. It has been around since the 90&amp;rsquo;s to mitigate complexities inherent in X.500 usage. Its name refers to Lightweight Directory Access Protocol. Soon after the first standard was issued, the first full LDAP server was created and X.500 became obsolete.
We&amp;rsquo;ll use the term LDAP to represent the protocol and LDAP server to represent the server that implements it.</description>

      <description>1.2 - Network Layer This layer is the part the user connects to when he wants to obtain some data from the server. This is not a mandatory part of the server : we don&amp;rsquo;t need to use it when the server is embedded.
We offer more than just LDAP protocol, the server also include various protocols :
 Kerberos NTP DHCP DNS ChangePassword  Not all of them are implemented in the current version, but at least the Kerberos server is available.</description>

      <description>1.2 - What ANSI RBAC is not   User Groups (i.e. LDAP groupOfUniqueNames). In RBAC, Roles are many-to-many mappings between User and Permission entities. Furthermore the assignments and grants may be interrogated, added or removed at any time. Roles should fall within a hierarchy which facilitate control over assets, encourages reuse and reduces the number of entitlements that have to be maintained.

      <description>1.3 - DirectoryService The DirectoryService is the core of the server. This is where we process incoming requests and ask the backend for data.
It has an entry point, the OperationManager, which is in charge of pushing the requests into the Interceptors chain, and to protect the server against concurrent modifications.
Then the request is going through every Interceptor being registered for this operation. When we have gone through all the Interceptors, we have reached the PartitionNexus, which is the connection with the backends.</description>

      <description>1.3 - The Apache LDAP API rationale When contemplating the creation of a new Java API for LDAP, we needed to first consider whether it was really necessary, because there were already a number of libraries that did it. For example:
 JNDI : the default JDK API Netscape (a.k.a Mozilla) LdapSdk OpenLDAP JLdap  So why is the development of our new LDAP API for Java NOT the NIH syndrome?</description>

      <description>1.4 - Interceptors Interceptors are functional layers inside the DirectoryService. Each one of them are responsible for a specific task. They are ordered, and this order is not to be changed.
Each operation received by the DirectoryService will be processed by various interceptors, one after the other, down to the backend, and again when the result comes back to the caller. An interceptor can call the next interceptor, whcih will be determinated by the position it has in the chain of interceptors, or simply return.</description>

      <description>1.4 - Preparation to code The Apache Directory LDAP API requires Java 8 or higher.
Secondly, you must download the API 1.0 or API 2.0. This package contains the LDAP API plus all of its dependent jars (like commons-lang, slf4j&amp;hellip;).
If you&amp;rsquo;re using Maven, add the following dependency on api-all.jar :
&amp;lt;dependency&amp;gt; &amp;lt;groupId&amp;gt;org.apache.directory.api&amp;lt;/groupId&amp;gt; &amp;lt;artifactId&amp;gt;api-all&amp;lt;/artifactId&amp;gt; &amp;lt;version&amp;gt;${ldap-api-version}&amp;lt;/version&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/dependency&amp;gt; and all of its dependent jar files will be included automatically. That&amp;rsquo;s it, now you should be ready to code!</description>

      <description>1.6. - Backup/Restore You may want to save your data in a safe place, and be able to restore them.
ApacheDS stores its data into a set of files, which are binary files. You can&amp;rsquo;t simply copy those files in a backup directory, because there is no guarantee that their state is consistant when you do a copy (unless you have stopped the server while doing so) : one update operation might be running when you do a copy, and unless this update has been completed, the database is nt in a stable state.</description>

 an OID, unique to this Control, as an identifier a Criticality flag, which tells if the control can be ignored or not a value, which might be BER encoded  We have 20 Controls declared in the LDAP API, and we can add more.

Here is the syntax for the extended Operation :
ExtendedRequest ::= [APPLICATION 23] SEQUENCE { requestName [0] LDAPOID, requestValue [1] OCTET STRING OPTIONAL } ExtendedResponse ::= [APPLICATION 24] SEQUENCE { COMPONENTS OF LDAPResult, responseName [10] LDAPOID OPTIONAL, responseValue [11] OCTET STRING OPTIONAL } (the payload is the requestValue or responseValue part, which may be BER encoded).</description>

      <description>2 - Basic LDAP API usage (&amp;hellip;) We provide three different sets of methods to send requests to the LDAP server:
 The first set is the simplest. Its methods don&amp;rsquo;t return a response but may throw a LdapOperationException if the operation was not successful. The second set is for advanced users. It works with dedicated Request and Response objects and allows fine-grained control at the LDAP protocol level. The third set allows users to send asynchronous requests.</description>

  The all module is just a packaging module, gathering all the other modules in one single jar to simplify the work for those who want to use the API. One can import each module speparately, or the all module only. Note that it does not include the tests and integration modules (integ, integ-osgi and distribution)</description>

      <description>2.1 - MVCC B-tree MVCC stands for Multi Version Concurrency Ccontrol. It all boils down to allow readers to ALWAYS have a consistent version of the data they reached at the time they started to work with them. In other words, when a reader access the database, it will work on a specific version of it, that will never change.
The drawback is that the data may be accurate at the time the reader started to work with them, but this reader will never see the updated data if a writer has modified them.</description>

One can also update server configuration using LDAP operations, as the configuration is stored in the DIT. Note that the server must be restarted after modifying the configuration.
We will then describe the installation layout (ie, how the various files are stored on the disk).</description>

      <description>2.1 - Configuration Description It&amp;rsquo;s a good practice to not modify the configuration LDIF file by hand, instead use the Studio Configuration plugin to modify the server configuration.
Overall structure The configuration is stored in a hierarchical order, where sub-elements are related to their parent. For instance, the Transports are associated to the corresponding Server that uses them. Each server may contain one or more transports.
The following hierarchy describe the different kind of elements that one can configure, and their relationship :</description>

      <description>2.1 - Connection and disconnection The LDAP is a protocol requires users to be connected, and likely identified (authenticated), before sending requests to the server. This connection can potentially be maintained forever. What makes the LDAP protocol different from, say, the HTTP protocol is that the connections are issued explicitly. Here we&amp;rsquo;ll see how it&amp;rsquo;s done.
Opening a connection We can open a secure or a standard connection.
Standard connection We can first establish a standard connection, where the data is sent and received in clear text (encoded in ASN.</description>

 Addition Deletion Modification Move and/or rename  (The last operation allows a user to move, rename or move and rename entries).
We will show how to add or delete entries in the following chapters, just to show you how it works with Apache Directory Server.</description>

      <description>Fortress Multitenancy Multitenancy Defined (From Wikipedia)
Multitenancy refers to a principle in software architecture where a single instance of the software runs on a server, serving multiple client organizations (tenants). Multitenancy is contrasted with a multi-instance architecture where separate software instances (or hardware systems) are set up for different client organizations. With a multitenant architecture, a software application is designed to virtually partition its data and configuration, and each client organization works with a customized virtual application instance.</description>

 The entry must exist; It should not have any children; The user requiring the deletion must have enough priviledge to do so  Assuming those three conditions being fulfilled, you can proceed with the deletion.</description>

      <description>2.2 - Binding and unbinding In LDAP, if one wants to access the data in the base, the common way to do it is to bind to the server. However, it&amp;rsquo;s important to understand that binding is a different from connecting.
Creating a connection to an LDAP server opens a socket between the client and the server. You must provide the address and the port in order to do this.</description>

      <description>Traditional Multi-Instances architecture Multitenancy Defined (From Wikipedia)
Multitenancy refers to a principle in software architecture where a single instance of the software runs on a server, serving multiple client organizations (tenants). Multitenancy is contrasted with a multi-instance architecture where separate software instances (or hardware systems) are set up for different client organizations. With a multitenant architecture, a software application is designed to virtually partition its data and configuration, and each client organization works with a customized virtual application instance.</description>

      <description>2.2.1 - Simple search Basically, a search in LDAP requires a few parameters :
 A server on which we will send the request A port for this server A base DN, the location where to start the search from A filter to select the entries to be returned The user doing the search A password if the user is not already bound A scope, defining the depth we should look for The list of attributes to return  There are several other options, which will be exposed in the next chapter.</description>

      <description>2.2.2 - More search options There are many parameters we haven&amp;rsquo;t explained in the previous chapter.
Bound/anonymous searches When you send a SearchRequest to the server, you may be anonymous, or you may have been bound before the search is done. Binding on a server creates an LDAP session, which stores the credentials. This is used by the authorization system to filter the requests and the returned data, depending on the server settings.</description>

      <description>2.3 - Searching (&amp;hellip;) Searching is the most important operation in LDAP. It has to be fast, very fast. On the other hand, as the server does the processing while looking for entries, the client must provide information to get accurate results.
The idea is to define a search API which is easy to use in the simplest cases, but provides all the capability to send complex search requests.

      <description>2.3 - The Schema All the data stored into a LDAP server are structured following a schema, a bit like any DBMS. Apache Directory Server does have a dynamic schema : that means you can modify the schema without having to restart the server.
We won&amp;rsquo;t describe in the basic user guide how to manage the schema, this will be extensively described in the Advanced user guide, this chapter is just a short introduction.</description>

Is it always necessary to define my own schema elements? No. ApacheDS comes with a comprehensive set of predefined, standardized schema elements (like inetOrgPerson). It is quite common to solely use the predefined schema.</description>

      <description>2.6 - Modifying entries There are several ways an entry can be modified. Mainly, it&amp;rsquo;s about adding or deleting an attribute, or modifying the values associated with an existing attribute.
It&amp;rsquo;s important to understand that many modifications can be applied on a single entry. All those modifications will be applied in an all or none fashion. i.e., if any of the modifications are invalid, none will occur. Also if the server crashes while applying the mods, it&amp;rsquo;s guaranteed that the entry remains consistent.</description>

Actually, changing an entry&amp;rsquo;s name *may have an impact on the entry&amp;rsquo;s content, as the DN always contains elements that are part of the entry.</description>

      <description>3 - Building The project is based on Apache Maven (version 3.x), so you&amp;rsquo;ll have to install it first.
That being said, building the LDAP API is pretty straightforward :
$ mvn clean install Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM warning: ignoring option MaxPermSize=256M; support was removed in 8.0 [INFO] Scanning for projects... [INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------ [INFO] Reactor Build Order: [INFO] [INFO] Apache Directory LDAP API [INFO] Apache Directory LDAP API I18n [INFO] Apache Directory LDAP API Utilities .</description>

      <description>3.1 - Controls A LDAP Control is an extension to an operation. It tells the server to do something aside the standard operation, or it let the server send back some information to the client. A Control contains three different parts :
 An identifier, the control OID A flag telling the server what to do if it does not know about the control or if it results in an error (either return an error or ignore the control) A value which is generally BER encoded  There are many controls available, some being standardized, other being server specific.</description>

      <description>3.1. Administrative points An Administrative Point is an entry which is defining a starting point from which some of the four existing administrative roles will span. It&amp;rsquo;s important to understand than an Administrative Point (or AP) comes hand in hand with the associated Subentries, otherwise it&amp;rsquo;s useless.
Any entry can be defined as an AP.
In the following schema, we have depicted a DIT with three APs, the big one being an AAP, the blue one is a SAP and the green one is an IAP.</description>

      <description>3.2 - Basic authorization This section describes the default authorization functionality of ApacheDS 1.5, which is very simple. On the other hand, it is inadequate for most serious deployments. Therefore a basic example to the &amp;ldquo;real&amp;rdquo; authorization subsystem is provided as well.
 What is authorization?  Authorization for directory operations vs. group membership   Default authorization behavior for directory operations  Sample data within &amp;ldquo;ou=users,ou=system&amp;rdquo; Rules and sample operations Is this sufficient?</description>

      <description>3.2 Operations on an Administrative Point There are six kind of operations we can have on an AdministrativePoint :
 creating a new AP removing an existing AP modifying an existing AP by adding or removing a role renaming an AP moving an AP renaming or moving an AP  Renaming an AP has no impact on the administrative model, as we don&amp;rsquo;t point (internally) on the entry&amp;rsquo;s DN, but on its UUID, so the last three operations can be gathered into one single Move operation.</description>

The LDAP protocol is based on an ASN/1 description. We will notexplain in detail what is ASN/1 about, you would rather check This page for a very limited introduction, or if you feel teh need to understand what is ASN/1 in detail, just read the Olivier Dubuisson&amp;rsquo;s book on ASN.1 (This is probably the best reference !)
Anyway, we use a subset of ASN/1, as what we have to deal with is the BER/DER encoding.</description>

      <description>4 - Schema Management Every LDAP server necessarily has a schema that&amp;rsquo;s used to define its accepted data elements along with their rules for usage (syntax).
An LDAP Schema is a complex combination of many schema elements. Here&amp;rsquo;s we&amp;rsquo;ll define those schema elements and how to organize them. Last, but not least, we&amp;rsquo;ll explain how to leverage the schema on the client side.

      <description>4.1 - ASN/1 TLV What are TLVs ? The acronym TLV stands for Tag, Length and Value. It&amp;rsquo;s a way to encode a piece of information with a type, a length followed by the information itself. Three points must be known:
 The Value part may contents other TLVs. One can see TLVs as C structures, that can contain sub-structures. The Value may not exist, and in this case the Length will be 0.</description>

You first have to make sure kinit is installed.
You can check that by typing kinit in a console :
$ kinit --version kinit (Heimdal 1.4.1apple1) Copyright 1995-2010 Kungliga Tekniska Högskolan Send bug-reports to heimdal-bugs@h5l.org $  Then, you have to configure the krb5.conf file (it can be found in /etc/krb5.conf, if not just add it).
A minimal /etc/krb5.conf file looks as follows (make sure the port and host name matches!</description>

      <description>4.1 - Schema A Schema is a set of elements that are used by the LDAP Server to describe the data that are stored. The top two elements are ObjectClass and AttributeType. An ObjectClass is a container, describing what an LDAP entry can contain, while an AttributeType describe each singe element stored in this container.
The key here is that an LDAP entry uses ObjectClasses to list all the possible AttributeTypes that an entry can contain, some of them being mandatory, some other optional.</description>

      <description>4.1.1 - Simple Authentication This authentication mode uses a Simple Bind Request. It&amp;rsquo;s just about sending a name and a password to the server, which will either create a session for the given credentials, or reject the request.
As we said, we have to pass a name and a password. This leads to three different combinations of Simple Bind :
 4.1.1.1 - Anonymous Authentication 4.1.1.2 - Name/Password Authentication 4.1.1.3 - Unauthenticated Authentication  The second mechanism is a normal authentication.</description>

      <description>4.1.1.1 - Anonymous Authentication When we don&amp;rsquo;t provide a name or password while proceeding to a Bind, we enter into an Anonymous mode. This is a mode that the server must allow, otherwise the user won&amp;rsquo;t be authenticated.
It worth noticing that one can do a search on a server without first authenticating : the search will be done with an anonymous status (in other words, an Anonymous session will be created in this case).</description>

      <description>4.1.1.2 - Name/Password Authentication This is the most common authentication system, though not the safest. The user provides his name and a password. Both are passed as clear text to the server, which checks that the user exists, and that its password is correct.
User&amp;rsquo;s name retrieval The first thing the server does is to check that the user&amp;rsquo;s name exists in the server. The provided name is always a full DN.</description>

      <description>4.1.1.3 - Unauthenticated Authentication The Unauthenticated Authentication mechanism is a bit specific. First of all, none all the LDAP servers support such a mechanism. In fact, the default behavior is for server to return a unwillingToPerform result code when someone tries to bind using a null password.

      <description>4.1.2.1 SASL PLAIN Authentication The SASL PLAIN authentication is most certainly useless, as one can already authenticate using the Simple Bind. However, it&amp;rsquo;s still possible to issue a SASL PLAIN authentication on ApacheDS.
The difference with a Simple Bind is that the user&amp;rsquo;s name is not DN, but a meaningful value that is stored into one of the user&amp;rsquo;s entry Attributes.
When the server receives a SASL PLAIN bind request, it will look for the first entry which uid is equal to the provided value, starting from the server searchBaseDN position in the DIT.</description>

      <description>4.1.2.2 - SASL CRAM-MD5 Authentication The CRAM-MD5 SASL mechanism is defined by RFC 2195.
We will have an exchange between the client, which will send an empty Bind request (i.e., the username and credentials won&amp;rsquo;t be sent the first time), and the server will return a challenge.
It&#39;s not recommended to use this mechanism.  Usage The client first send a BindRequest with no credentials:
MessageType : BIND_REQUEST Message ID : 1 BindRequest Version : &#39;3&#39; Name : &#39;null&#39; Sasl credentials Mechanism :&#39;CRAM-MD5&#39; Credentials : null  The server will return a BindResponse with a SASL_BIND_IN_PROGRESS status :</description>

      <description>4.1.2.3 - SASL DIGEST-MD5 Authentication The DIGEST-MD5 SASL mechanism is defined by RFC 2829, which has been moved to an historic status by RFC 6331, due to its intrinsic weaknesses.
It&#39;s not recommended to use this mechanism.  Usage As for CRAM-MD5 mechanism, there is an exchange between the server and the client. First, the client sends a BindRequest with no credentials :
MessageType : BIND_REQUEST Message ID : 1 BindRequest Version : &#39;3&#39; Name : &#39;null&#39; Sasl credentials Mechanism :&#39;DIGEST-MD5&#39; Credentials : null  The server responds with a BindResponses containing a challenge :</description>

      <description>4.1.2.4 - SASL GSSAPI Authentication This authentication mechanism is specified in the following RFCs :
* [RFC 4752](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4752)  It&amp;rsquo;s more specifically used for Kerberos V5 authentication. As Apache Directory Server is also a Kerberos Server, it comes as a natural extension of the server.
It requires some configuration though.
Configuration The idea is for the LDAP server to delegate the authentication to the Kerberos Server.
Usage MessageType : BIND_REQUEST Message ID : 1 BindRequest Version : &amp;lsquo;3&amp;rsquo; Name : &#39;&amp;rsquo; Sasl credentials Mechanism :&amp;lsquo;GSSAPI&amp;rsquo; Credentials : (omitted-for-safety)</description>

      <description>4.2.4.1 - EntryACI Entry ACI are access controls added to entries to protect that entry specifically. Meaning the protected entry is the entry where the ACI resides. When performing an operation on an entry, ApacheDS checks for the presence of the multivalued operational attribute, entryACI. The values of the entryACI attribute contain ACIItems.
There is one exception to the rule of consulting entryACI attributes within ApacheDS: add operations do not consult the entryACI within the entry being added.</description>

      <description>4.2.4.2 - PrescriptiveACI Prescriptive ACI are access controls that are applied to a collection of entries, not just to a single entry. Collections of entries are defined by the subtreeSpecifications of subentries. Hence prescriptive ACI are added to subentries as attributes and are applied by ApacheDS to the entries selected by the subentry&amp;rsquo;s subtreeSpecification. ApacheDS uses the prescriptiveACI multivalued operational attribute within subentries to contain ACIItems that apply to the entry collection.</description>

      <description>4.2.4.3 - SubentryACI Access to subentries also needs to be controlled. Subentries are special in ApacheDS. Although they subordinate to an administrative entry (entry of an Administrative Point), they are technically considered to be in the same context as their administrative entry. ApacheDS considers the perscriptive ACI applied to the administrative entry, to also apply to its subentries.
This however is not the most intuitive mechanism to use for explicitly controlling access to subentries.</description>

      <description>4.3. Password Policy The Password Policy for LDAP Directories is a RFC draft that has been designed for the very first version in 1999, and the latest version is from 2009. Although it&amp;rsquo;s still a draft, and it&amp;rsquo;s currently noted as inactive, it has been implemented by many existing LDAP servers.
ApacheDS implements most of the draft.
Enforcing a strict password policy is extremely punitive to users. It may leads users to workaround the policy by storing their password in a post-it, a workaround that will defeat any password policy.</description>

      <description>5 - LDAP Security LDAP databases store critical information that must be kept secure. The Apache LDAP API can access the data securely while in flight but can&amp;rsquo;t protect it while at rest &amp;ndash; that&amp;rsquo;s for the database system itself to do.
Generally speaking when it comes to securing a system, we are addressing the three As: Authentication, Authorization and Auditing.
The only aspect we will focus on is the Authentication part, because the LDAP protocol does not address the other two, when it comes to an API.</description>

As MINA is fully asynchronous, it has some impact on the design of the LDAP API. Basically, we send requests, and we don&amp;rsquo;t wait for responses, we get informed when the response is there.</description>

      <description>5.1 - LDAPS LDAP supports SSL, it&amp;rsquo;s called LDAPS, and it uses a dedicated port. As of today, and since 2000, LDAPS is deprecated and StartTLS should be used.
That being said, many servers accept LDAPS, and the Apache LDAP API supports it.
How does it work ? The SSL protocol ensures that data is transmitted encrypted, and guarantees that the data received is valid. Noone can capture this data and read it, assuming the ciphers used are of sufficient strength.</description>

      <guid>https://directory.apache.org/api/user-guide/5.2-start-tls.html</guid>
      <description>5.2 - StartTLS As we have seen in the previous chapter, LDAPS has some drawbacks. There is a better alternative for securing communications between the client and server &amp;ndash; startTLS.
The idea is to use an existing connection to send a message to the server and request it to be encrypted. We keep going with the current connection, on the same port, but the exchanged data will continue as encrypted.</description>

Logs can be configured by modifying the log4j.properties file which can be found in the conf directory of the server instance (see the previous chapter &amp;ldquo;5.1 - Layout&amp;quot;).

In any case, as ApacheDS and the Apache LDAP API are based on Java, we depend on the Java SASL impementation. Typically, this is handled by the SunSASL provider, which only support the following mechanisms, as of Java 8 :</description>

Initial steps The below initial conditions must be met before configuring the replication in any mode.
  Make sure all the servers are up and running
  Add the configuration of the partition whose data needs to be replicated. For example if we like to replicate the partition dc=apache,dc=org then make sure to configure this partition in all the servers that are configured to replicate.</description>

What exactly is an interceptor? An interceptor filters method calls performed on on the DefaultPartitionNexus just like Servlet filters do. The ApacheDS configuration contains a chain of filters performing several tasks.</description>

      <description>6.27 - Oid Introduction An OID stands for Object IDentifier. It&amp;rsquo;s part of the ASN/1 standard. Basically, it&amp;rsquo;s a hierarchy, named a &amp;lsquo;registration tree&amp;rsquo;. It&amp;rsquo;s a list of &amp;lsquo;arcs&amp;rsquo;, which values start at &amp;lsquo;0&amp;rsquo;, and each arc is separated with a dot ( &amp;lsquo;.&amp;rsquo; ).
There are three defined root arcs :
* itu-t (0) * iso (1) * joint-iso-itu-t (2)  There are some places on the internet where one can look at the existing OIDs.</description>

      <description>6.3 - Attribute The Attribute class is used to store values associated with an AttributeType. An Entry can contain many Attribute{s, but only one of them is mandatory: the ObjectClass Attribute.
An Attribute can store zero, one or N values, accordingly to its associated AttributeType, which may allow null values, and which also can forbid muli-values.
The Attribute has a internal AttributeType which is usually defined using its name. This name is case insensitive, and we can also use the AttributeType OID.</description>

      <guid>https://directory.apache.org/api/user-guide/6.35-value.html</guid>
      <description>6.35 - Value The Value class is used to store an attribute&amp;rsquo;s value. Such a value can be either a String or a byte[], depending on the nature of the AttributeType (the default is that the Value is a String). Each value is associated to an AttributeType, and is used in an Entry or a DN.
We can create a schema aware Value, or just a plain Value. Having a schema aware Value allows further controls to be made on the value injected : its syntax will be checked against the AttributeType syntax.</description>

      <description>6.4 - AttributeType The AttributeType is one of the most important schema elements. It describes what can be stored into an Entry, its syntax, and the various rules that are to be followed whenever searching for an associated value.
AttributeType are immutable objects, created from the schema, and never changed. One can add a new AttributeType, or delete itfrom the schema, but once it&amp;rsquo;s added to the schema, it can&amp;rsquo;t be modified.</description>

      <description>6.5 - Ava An Ava is used to store an Attribute value associated to an AttributeType.
It describes a container holding an AttributeType associated with a Value in a Rdn. An example would be:
dc=example where &amp;lsquo;dc&amp;rsquo; is the AttributeType and &amp;lsquo;example&amp;rsquo; its associated value.
The value can be a binary or a String value, depending on the AttributeType.
We can create a schema aware Ava, or just a plain Ava.</description>

      <description>6.7 - Control (&amp;hellip;) A LDAP Control is an extension to an operation. It tells the server to do something aside the standard operation, or it let the server send back some information to the client. A Control contains three different parts :
 An identifier, the control OID A flag telling the server what to do if it does not know about the control or if it results in an error (either return an error or ignore the control) A value which is generally BER encoded  There are many controls available, some being standardized, other being server specific.</description>

      <description>7 - Embedding ApacheDS in Java Using ApacheDS for unit tests The idea is to use ADS as an embedded server for Ldap junit tests. We will build an environment in which it will be convenient to test Ldap applications.
We also want to avoid launching the server for every test, as it&amp;rsquo;s an expensive operation. We have built ApacheDS so that you can start a server, inject some data, launch a test, then revert the data and go on to another test.</description>

We can have three different ways to use Mavibot :
 using in-memory BTrees (IN-MEMORY) using in-memory BTrees stored on disk (PERSISTED) storing the BTrees on disk (so called managed BTrees) (MANAGED)  In Memory BTrees They are BTrees stored in memory : as soon as you quit your program, all the stored data will be lost.</description>

      <description>7.2 - Physical storage When associated with a RecordManager, Mavibot stores all the Btrees in one single file, which is split in many physical pages, all having the same size.
 Note Currently, the choice was to use same size for all the pages, regardless of the data stored into them. The rationnal is to get close to the OS page size (frequently 512 bytes or 4096 bytes). This is not necessarily the best choice though, let&amp;rsquo;s say it&amp;rsquo;s something we might want to change later.</description>

      <description>7.3 - Serializations The logical pages are serialized before storing in physical pages. This is a process that should obviously be reversible. In this chapter, we will describe how to serialize a Leaf and Node.
Leaf serialization A Leaf contains some metadata, and a set of keys and values. A key can have many values, and we have as many keys as values. The internal format of a serialized leaf contains:</description>

      <guid>https://directory.apache.org/apacheds/advanced-ug/8-operational-attributes.html</guid>
      <description>8 - Operational Attributes Operational attributes are attributes that are used internally by the server. They generally can&amp;rsquo;t be modified by a user, although one can read them.
In order to retrieve an operational attribute, you have to require it explicitely, or request all of them using the special attribute &amp;lsquo;+&amp;rsquo;.
RFC 4512 defines four different flavors of AttributeType :
 userApplications : User&amp;rsquo;s attributes directoryOperation : Server&amp;rsquo;s attributes dSAOperation : Server&amp;rsquo;s attributes that have no meant in being distributed distributedOperation : Server&amp;rsquo;s attribute that are used in a distributed environment  ApacheDS support a list of standard LDAP operational attributes, plus a few that are specific.</description>

      <description>8 - Schema Schema parsers We use a set of classes to parse schema elements. There are 11 flavors of schema elements, 8 of them being described in a RFC, 3 of them being ApacheDS proprietary:
 AttributeType DitContentRule DitStructureRule LDAPSyntax MatchingRule MatchingRuleUse NameForm ObjectClass  and
 LdapComparator Normalizer SyntaxChecker  We need to be able to parse those schema elements because they can be added into the server as a description (ie, a String representing one of those schema elements as defined by the RFC).</description>

 The instance directory, ie the base directory for the server : $BASE The configuration directory : ${BASE}/conf/ The log directory : ${BASE}/log/ The partition directory, which will contain the data : ${BASE}/partitions/ The run directory, which will contain the server PID : ${BASE}/run/ The cache directory, containing the cache files : ${BASE}/cache/  All those directories will be created if they do not exist already.</description>

      <description>9 - DN A DN, or Distinguished Name is a data structure that is composed of a list of RDN (Relative DN). Each RDN is composed of a list of AVA (AttributeType And Value).
In a DN, the list of RDN is ordered from the most significant to the least significant RDN. For instance:
cn=JohnDoe,ou=apache,dc=com  The most significant RDN is cn=JohnDoe.
RDN A RDN can be composed of many AVAs, which are ordered in two ways:</description>

      <description>Introduction ADS 2.0 configuration has been completely reworked since 1.0 and 1.5 versions. While those two versions were XML based, we decided to store the new configuration in the DiT (Directory Information Tree).
It&amp;rsquo;s now available either through an LDAP browser, programatically using an LDAP API or simply by editing the LDIF files stored on the disk.

Configuration structure ADS is more than a LDAP server. It&amp;rsquo;s also a Kerberos server, a DNS Server and a DHCP server.</description>

Value Those classes/interface were removed :
 AbstractValue BinaryValue StringValue  They are all replaced by a single class, Value, that is not anymore parametered.
We now have to use the Value class only. That is not a really big trouble, as everywhere you were using Value*, you just have to remove the *.</description>

      <description>ApacheDS Features The Apache Directory Server is an embeddable LDAP server implemented in pure Java. It has several features that make it unique among LDAP servers. Some of these featurea are as follows:
 Designed as an LDAP and X.500 platform; plugable components and subsystems make ApacheDS extremely modular and ideal for experiments with various aspects of the LDAP protocol. The server&amp;rsquo;s frontend is completely separable from its backend and vice-versa making it very flexible for implementing virtual directories, proxy servers and gateways to X.</description>

      <description>Fortress History In 2009 a small team of developers[1], who are brothers, began work on the Open Access Manager project. From its onset, the push behind this project was to build a fully functioning security authorization system that&amp;rsquo;s based on open standards and wholly open source. In particular, Role-Based Access Control (ANSI INCITS 359) was a focal point, although that adherence brought with it a need for expanded coverage into other areas like auditing and administration.</description>

      <description>Issue Tracking Our project uses JIRA, a Java EE based issue tracking and project management application.
Issues, bugs, and feature requests should be submitted to the following issue tracking system.
As a general advice, server bugs must be added into DIRSERVER, not DIR. The DIR token should be used for general problems like documentation errors, and general problems not related to the server itself. Following this advice will help us a lot to improve bug tracking and resolution :-)     Directory Sub-Project JIRA key Link to issue tracking system     ApacheDS DIRSERVER https://issues.</description>

      <description>Vision When we started to work on replication implementation, we needed a client API in order to communicate using the LDAP protocol with remote LDAP servers. We could have used some existing LDAP API, but as we have already defined a lot of base classes we would have had to convert back and forth, we thought it would be better to build the missing pieces and define our own complete LDAP API.</description>

      <description>Fortress Load Testing Fortress uses Apache Jmeter, driven by the Apache Maven Jmeter plugin. Typical tests insert millions of entries and process authentication and authorization requests at very high throughput rates. For production deployments, it&amp;rsquo;s not unusual to run tests for many days, even weeks, to verify that the environment can handle the expected loads, over time, without degradation or faults.
How fast/long can it run? Take it for a test drive in your env and find out.</description>

Introduction This document contains an overview for combining a CAS-based SSO module with fortress-based authorization, using a declarative URL filtering mechanism.
Detailed description of the project I created this solution a few years ago because at the time I was looking for an IAM and SSO solution, and there were no open source solutions that provided everything that I needed.</description>

      <description>Vision The Apache Directory Server is using an old package to manage its data : JDBM. This is a simple - but functional - BTree implementation in Java. It support transactions and storage on disk.
So far, so good. Except that it&amp;rsquo;s kind of slow, and more important, it does not support concurrent reads and writes.
At some point, we decided to go for another implementation, but for a MVCC BTree.</description>

      <description>Apache Directory LDAP API&amp;trade; The modern Java LDAP API The Apache Directory LDAP API is an ongoing effort to provide an enhanced LDAP API, as a replacement for JNDI and the existing LDAP API (jLdap and Mozilla LDAP API). This is a &#34;schema aware&#34; API with some convenient ways to access all types of LDAP servers, not only ApacheDS but any LDAP server. The API is OSGI ready and extensible. New controls, schema elements and network layer could be added or used in the near future.</description>
