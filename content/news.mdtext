The Apache Directory team is pleased to announce the release of ApacheDS 2.0.0-M8, the eigth milestone toward a 2.0 version.

ApacheDS is an extensible and embeddable directory server entirely written in Java, which has been certified LDAPv3 compatible by the Open Group. Besides LDAP it supports Kerberos 5 and the Change Password Protocol. It has been designed to introduce triggers, stored procedures, queues and views to the world of LDAP which has lacked these rich constructs.

## Apache Directory LDAP API 1.0.0-M13 released _posted on Friday 12, 2012_

The Apache Directory Team is proud to announce the availability of the 1.0.0-M13 version of the Apache Directory LDAP API.

The Apache Directory LDAP client API is an ongoing effort to provide an enhanced LDAP API, as a replacement for JNDI and the existing LDAP API (jLdap and Mozilla LDAP API).

This is a schema aware API, with some convenient ways to access a LDAP server. This API is not only targeting the Apache Directory Server, but should work pristine with any LDAP server.

It's also an extensible API : new Controls, schema elements and network layer could be added or used in the near future. It's also OSGi capable.

In this milestone, we have fixed some issues :

* [DIRAPI-87 - The search() method does not return the same result if it's done with a SearchRequest or with parameters](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/DIRSHARED-87)
* [DIRAPI-88 - RDN parsing fails with values containing a # character followed by other characters](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/DIRSHARED-88)
* [DIRSHARED-135 - LdapNetworkConnection should be thread-safe](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/DIRSHARED-135)
* [DIRSHARED-136 - NPE in AntlrSubtreeSpecificationParser when initialized with an empty schema manager](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/DIRSHARED-136)
* [DIRSHARED-137 - Logically incorrect filter construction while parsing DSML search request](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/DIRSHARED-137)
* [DIRSHARED-138 - Cannot transform SearchRequestDsml object to DSML format](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/DIRSHARED-138)
