      <title>1.1 - ANSI RBAC Explained</title>
      <link>https://directory.apache.org/fortress/user-guide/1.1-rbac-explained.html</link>

      <description>1.1 - ANSI RBAC Explained Misnomers abound as to what constitutes a working Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system. With ANSI RBAC, Groups are not Roles and resource connections not Sessions. This paper explains what ANSI RBAC is and how it can be applied to existing problem domains. It dispels longstanding myths persistent within the enterprise. Additionally readers receive tips on how to implement their own successful RBAC program and where to go to get a fully compliant ANSI RBAC system that may be used as a reference implementation.</description>

      <guid>https://directory.apache.org/fortress/user-guide/1.2-what-is-not-rbac.html</guid>
      <description>1.2 - What ANSI RBAC is not   User Groups (i.e. LDAP groupOfUniqueNames). In RBAC, Roles are many-to-many mappings between User and Permission entities. Furthermore the assignments and grants may be interrogated, added or removed at any time. Roles should fall within a hierarchy which facilitate control over assets, encourages reuse and reduces the number of entitlements that have to be maintained.

      <description>1.3 - What ANSI RBAC is There is more to RBAC than using a Role object during policy enforcement.
 ANSI INCITS 359-2001, http://profsandhu.com/journals/tissec/ANSI+INCITS+359-2004.pdf - The ANSI specification describes RBAC and provides functional specifications in Z-notation.   ![ANSI RBAC](images/ANSIRBAC-Spec.png)   RBAC0 - Users, Roles, Permissions (Objects-Operations), Sessions - Form the Core of ANSI RBAC. Role activation and Permissions mapped to Object-&amp;gt;Operation pairing are key facets of the basic ANSI RBAC model.</description>

      <title>1.4 - Why is ANSI RBAC Important?</title>
      <link>https://directory.apache.org/fortress/user-guide/1.4-why-rbac-is-important.html</link>

      <guid>https://directory.apache.org/fortress/user-guide/1.4-why-rbac-is-important.html</guid>
      <description>1.4 - Why is ANSI RBAC Important?   Enforces the concept of least privilege. Granting users business functionality doesn&amp;rsquo;t imply entitlements may be used at any time. For example a bank teller shouldn&amp;rsquo;t withdrawal money from customer accounts outside of normal business hours or freelance contractors don&amp;rsquo;t require access to production resources to do their jobs.

      <description>Fortress Multitenancy Multitenancy Defined (From Wikipedia)
Multitenancy refers to a principle in software architecture where a single instance of the software runs on a server, serving multiple client organizations (tenants). Multitenancy is contrasted with a multi-instance architecture where separate software instances (or hardware systems) are set up for different client organizations. With a multitenant architecture, a software application is designed to virtually partition its data and configuration, and each client organization works with a customized virtual application instance.</description>

      <guid>https://directory.apache.org/fortress/user-guide/2.3-multitenancy-under-covers.html</guid>
      <description>Multitenancy under the covers Under the covers The Fortress data design allows clients to share a single server instance because each has its own storage area set aside in the back end database. This increases operational efficiency of the hosting service providerâ€™s data center without sacrificing data isolation on behalf of the clients who use it.</description>

      <description>ApacheDS Installation guide Provide instructions to install an ApacheDS instance and setup for use with Fortress. In this configuration, there is an ApacheDS server running on a machine (ApacheDS Host) and Fortress agent which will be installed on a client machine (Fortress Host). Note that those two hosts can be shared - and this is such a configuration that we are going to use in this document.
Prerequisites There a few mandatory elements that need to be installed on the ApacheDS Host :</description>

However, in order to be able to share your &amp;lsquo;vision&amp;rsquo; with your code, some rules must be followed.
Hey, remember that those rules are not the best nor the worst, they are pretty much what they are for historical reasons, or for technical reasons, however, please, accept them as they are, and avoid religious war (please, oh please, no mail to say &amp;ldquo;WTF ?</description>

      <description>Installation guides The Fortress Core requires an LDAP server to store its information. Its other components, Web and Rest, require a Java Servlet container. This page includes some links on getting started.
Fortress Core Setup with LDAP The Core is used by the other components, Realm, Rest and Web. These are to install ApacheDS or OpenLDAP (pick one), and configure for usage. For rapid deployment, use DOCKER containers.

      <description>Fortress History In 2009 a small team of developers[1], who are brothers, began work on the Open Access Manager project. From its onset, the push behind this project was to build a fully functioning security authorization system that&amp;rsquo;s based on open standards and wholly open source. In particular, Role-Based Access Control (ANSI INCITS 359) was a focal point, although that adherence brought with it a need for expanded coverage into other areas like auditing and administration.</description>
