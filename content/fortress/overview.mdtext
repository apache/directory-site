# Fortress Overview

FORTRESS is a standards-based access management system, written in Java, that provides role-based access control, delegated administration and password policy services with LDAP.

## What's in it?  

Included are the following components:

* Core  - Java Access Management SDK
* Realm - Java EE security for Apache Tomcat
* Rest  - HTTP protocol wrappers for the APIs
* Web   - HTML pages for the APIs

It's released under terms of the Apache License 2.0.

## What technologies at play?

Fortress products run on open system hardware and software platforms supporting LDAPv3, HTTP & Java.  

## What standards apply?

The following standards are implemented...

### ANSI Role-Based Access Control (INCITS 359) 

There is more to RBAC than assigning users to groups and applying ACL policies within directories or databases.  [RBAC](http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/SNS/rbac/documents/draft-rbac-implementation-std-v01.pdf) systems provide selective Role activation/deactivation, role hierarchies, and constraints over separation of duty.  The [RBAC](http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/SNS/rbac/documents/draft-rbac-implementation-std-v01.pdf) component provides APIs to add, update, delete, and search the directory data

More info can be found on [Intro to ANSI RBAC Page](user-guide/1-intro-rbac.html)

### [Java EE Platform](http://java.net/projects/javaee-spec/pages/Home) (tm) Security

Used for SSL, X.509 mutual authentication, form-based container authentication, authorization and SSO.  Works within compliant Java Web apps like Fortress Rest and Web.  

### Administrative Role-Based Access Control ([ARBAC02](http://profsandhu.com/journals/tissec/p113-oh.pdf))

The ARBAC model explains how [RBAC](http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/SNS/rbac/documents/draft-rbac-implementation-std-v01.pdf) can be extended with organizational controls to govern policies regarding the security administration process. ARBAC helps by allowing administrative tasks be delegated to end users who fall outside typical datacenter operations. 

### IETF Password Policies

OpenLDAP has supported this draft since 2005.  Fortress adds by integrating with its administrative and access control APIs.  These APIs enable outside apps to participate and manipulate OpenLDAP password policies without understanding the specifics of how they work. Fortress provides services for setting up new policies and ensuring password policies are tracked and enforced across all avenues.

### Auditing

Fortress audits use OpenLDAP's slapd access log overlay.

The Fortress audits rely on slapd events to track its data exchanges performed within its own APIs.  Change event tracking includes adds, updates, and deletes of Fortress entities.  Read and search events tracked include user authentication, authorization, and policy interrogations.  Full historical data change tracking is maintained and may be searched later with APIs to be used for monitoring, reporting, and undo. The log may be retrieved later to synch with outside database for long-term regulatory and compliance concerns.  

### Temporal Constraints 

The Fortress Temporal model allows Users and Roles to carry time and date Constraints which govern when activations may occur. Role constraints are checked on every call into Fortress.  The user constraint applied only at session creation.

### ANSI RBAC Policy-Enhanced (INCITS-494-2012)

One day.

## What services are available?

Over one hundred services divided across the Manager components.

A description of these managers follow along with their associated javadoc links that describe the apis...
