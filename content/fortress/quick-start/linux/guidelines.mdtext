# Guidelines and Tips for first-time users


In the document that follows, when you read \[version\] or [platform] substitute with current package info. For example - if the downloaded package version is 1.0.0 and platform is 'Debian Silver i386', the instructions show fortressBuilder-\[platform\]-\[version\].jar your file name would be fortressBuilder-Debian-Silver-i386-1.0.0.zip

Is your target machine windows? Go to [README-QUICKSTART-WINDOWS](../windows/windows.html).

The source code for this project is located here ./src.

## Instructions to download, extract and configure Fortress Builder Package to Target System

* Download one of the linux packages from here: iamfortress.org/download
* Copy fortressBuilder-\[platform\]-\[version\].zip to hard drive on target server env.
* Extract the zip. The location for archive can vary according to requirements. The location of package will be referred to as FORTRESS_HOME later on.
*Enable permission for the binaries to execute. From FORTRESS_HOME root folder, enter the following command from a system prompt:

    chmod a+x -Rf *
