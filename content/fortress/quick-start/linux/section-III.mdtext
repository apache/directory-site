After above step completes, Symas OpenLDAP will be installed, configured and loaded with fortress bootstrap config. This step also runs provisioning scripts which may be tailored according to requirements. Check out the xml load scripts in FORTRESS_HOME/ldap/setup folder.

Point your preferred LDAP browser, ours is Apache Directory Studio, to the installed directory. The configuration parameters you'll need to browse can be found in the generated 'slapd.conf' file.

To view data stored in default database:

	suffix "dc=openldap,dc=org" 
	rootdn "cn=Manager,dc=openldap,dc=org" 
	rootpw "secret"

The root pw will be encrypted before stored in slapd.conf
