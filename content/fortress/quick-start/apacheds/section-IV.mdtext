    WARNING messages in test output are good as these are negative tests in action.

<DIV class="note" markdown="1">
    If you made it this far without junit or ant ERRORS, the Fortress and ApacheDS IAM system are certified to run on your machine. 
</DIV>

<DIV class="note" markdown="1">
    These tests load tens of thousands of records into your newly installed directory. The 'init-apacheds' and 'test-full' targets may be re-run as often as necessary. After regressions testing has completed, you may run the 'init-apacheds' target to remove all test data from the directory.
