## Section I - Instructions to extract and configure Fortress Builder Package to Target System

### Step 1

Copy fortressBuilder-\[platform\]-\[version\].zip to hard drive on target server env.

### Step 2

Extract the zip. The location for archive can vary according to requirements. The location of package will be referred to as FORTRESS_HOME later on.

### Step 3

Enable permission for the binaries to execute. From FORTRESS_HOME root folder, enter the following command from a system prompt:

    chmod a+x -Rf * 

<CENTER>
  <IMG src="../../images/Screenshot1-chmod.png" alt="Screenshot" width="766" height="58"/>
</CENTER>

### Step 4

Edit file named 'build.properties' and insert LDAP configuration parameters: 

    ldap.server.type=apacheds

    # These parameters point fortress to LDAP host:
    ldap.host=localhost
    ldap.port=10389

    # These are used to construct suffix for DIT, i.e. dc=example,dc=com.
    suffix.name=example
    suffix.dc=com

    # These are the connection parameters used for LDAP service account:
    root.dn=uid=admin,ou=system

    # Used to load OpenLDAP admin root password in slapd.conf and was encrypted using 'slappasswd' command:
    # This ApacheDS admin root password's value is 'secret', is bound for fortress.properties and was encrypted 
    #   using 'encrypt' target in build.xml:
    cfg.root.pw=W7T0G9hylKZQ4K+DF8gfgA==

    # If encryption of LDAP &/or HTTP service account passwords (e.g. cfg.root.pw, 
    #   cfg.log.root.pw and http.pw params) is required, this field must be set.
    # If encryption of service accounts not needed, leave this value blank, and set the password values for 
    #   cfg.root.pw, cfg.log.root.pw and http.pw to be their clear text value.
    # Use any arbitrary value here but must be same as key used to encrypt.
    crypto.prop=abcd12345
