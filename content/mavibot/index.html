<h2 class="news">Apache Mavibot 1.0.0-M8 released <em>posted on August 16th, 2015</em></h2>
<p>The Apache Directory team is pleased to announce the release of Apache Mavibot 1.0.0-M8 the
eighth milestone towards a 1.0 version.</p>
<p><strong>Mavibot</strong> is a Multi Version Concurrency Control (MVCC) BTree in Java. It is expected to be a
replacement for JDBM (The current backend for the <strong>Apache Directory Server</strong>), but could be a
good fit for any other project in need of a Java MVCC BTree implementation.</p>
<p>This version contains support for free-page management. It is not yet production ready, support
for cross-B-tree transaction system is not present yet, and this will be our target for the next
release.</p>
<p>Downloads are available <a href="downloads.html">here</a></p>

<h2 class="news">Apache Mavibot 1.0.0-M7 released <em>posted on March 27th, 2015</em></h2>
<p>The Apache Directory team is pleased to announce the release of Apache Mavibot 1.0.0-M7 the seventh milestone towards a 1.0 version.</p>
<p><strong>Mavibot</strong> is a Multi Version Concurrency Control (MVCC) BTree in Java. It is expected to be a replacement for JDBM (The current backend for the <strong>Apache Directory Server</strong>), but could be a good fit for any other project in need of a Java MVCC BTree implementation.</p>
<p>This version fixes some serious issues in the way we browse a B-tree, and in the transaction support. It&rsquo;s not yet
production ready, we still are missing the free-page management and a cross-B-tree transaction system, which will
be our target for the next release.</p>

<h2 class="news">Apache Mavibot 1.0.0-M6 released <em>posted on November 16th, 2014</em></h2>
<p>The Apache Directory team is pleased to announce the release of Apache Mavibot 1.0.0-M6, the sixth milestone towards a 1.0 version.</p>
<p><strong>Mavibot</strong> is a Multi Version Concurrency Control (MVCC) BTree in Java. It is expected to be a replacement for JDBM (The current backend for the <strong>Apache Directory Server</strong>), but could be a good fit for any other project in need of a Java MVCC BTree implementation.</p>
<p>This version brings a complete support for Bulk-Loading of persistent btrees, and fixes a few bugs :</p>
<ul>
<li>MAVIBOT-32 Add Bulk Load</li>
<li>MAVIBOT-34 Support revisions</li>
<li>MAVIBOT-36 Runtime dependencies on slf4j-log4j and log4j cause conflicts</li>
<li>MAVIBOT-42 The TupleCursor always reuse the same internal tuple instance&hellip;</li>
</ul>
<p>This is by far not the latest milestone</p>
<p><strong>ApacheDS</strong> has already been tested with <strong>Mavibot 1.0.0-M6-SNAPSHOT</strong></p>

<h2 class="news">Apache Mavibot 1.0.0-M5 released <em>posted on July 4th, 2014</em></h2>
<p>The Apache Directory team is pleased to announce the release of Apache Mavibot 1.0.0-M5, the fifth milestone towards a 1.0 version.</p>
<p><strong>Mavibot</strong> is a Multi Version Concurrency Control (MVCC) BTree in Java. It is expected to be a replacement for JDBM (The current backend for the <strong>Apache Directory Server</strong>), but could be a good fit for any other project in need of a Java MVCC BTree implementation.</p>
<p>This version brings some new improvements in the API and the performances. The In-memory and Persisted B-trees classes have
been moved into the same package, to avoid exposing the methods to the external world. We also have shared the common methods.</p>
<p>We have added a partial support for the bulk-load feature, and a few speed improvements.</p>
<p>This is by far not the latest milestone, the next one will bring major changes : revisions support, transaction support.</p>

<p>The Apache Directory team is pleased to announce the release of Apache Mavibot 1.0.0-M4, the forth milestone towards a 1.0 version.</p>
<p><strong>Mavibot</strong> is a Multi Version Concurrency Control (MVCC) BTree in Java. It is expected to be a replacement for JDBM (The current backend for the <strong>Apache Directory Server</strong>), but could be a good fit for any other project in need of a Java MVCC BTree implementation.</p>
<p>This version brings some new improvements in the API and the performances. The In-memory and Persisted B-trees classes have
been moved into the same package, to avoid exposing the methods to the external world. We also have shared the common methods.</p>
<p>Some specific exceptions have been created.</p>
<p>Here is the list of fixed issues :</p>
<p><b>Bug</b></p>
<pre><code>* MAVIBOT-20 - Btree created with the duplicateValues flag to false still accept duplicate values
</code></pre>
<p></b>Improvements</b></p>
<pre><code>* MAVIBOT-25 - Don't update the RMHeader for each free page we get
* MAVIBOT-27 - Aggregate the Persisted and InMemory common methods
* MAVIBOT-28 - Move the Persited and InMemory classes into the same package
* MAVIBOT-29 - Use a BtreeFactory to create BTrees
* MAVIBOT-30 - Replace the RuntimeException by specific exceptions
* MAVIBOT-33 - Serializer and comparator should be static instances
</code></pre>
<p>This is by far not the latest milestone, the next one will bring major changes : revisions support, transaction support.</p>

<h2 class="news">Apache Mavibot 1.0.0-M3 released <em>posted on December 16th, 2013</em></h2>
<p>The Apache Directory team is pleased to announce the release of Apache Mavibot 1.0.0-M3, the third milestone towards a 1.0 version.</p>
<p><strong>Mavibot</strong> is a Multi Version Concurrency Control (MVCC) BTree in Java. It is expected to be a replacement for JDBM (The current backend for the <strong>Apache Directory Server</strong>), but could be a good fit for any other project in need of a Java MVCC BTree implementation.</p>
<p>Some big refactoring in this milestone, as many of the classes and
interfaces are now comon to both the managed and in-memory btrees.
A replace method has been added, the cache is now shared with the
btree subtrees, and we don&rsquo;t create a subtrees for each values when
the BTree allows duplicate values, which leads to better performance.</p>
<p>Most important, we don&rsquo;t anymore deserialize the whole page when it
is read from disk, we just deserialize the needed keys and values.
This single change boost the performance by an order of magnitude.</p>
<p>The cursors have been refactored, and some tests have been added.</p>
<p>Many other bugs have been fixed.</p>

<h2 class="news">Apache Mavibot 1.0.0-M2 released <em>posted on November 6th, 2013</em></h2>
<p>The Apache Directory team is pleased to announce the release of Apache Mavibot 1.0.0-M2, the second milestone towards a 1.0 version.</p>
<p><strong>Mavibot</strong> is a Multi Version Concurrency Control (MVCC) BTree in Java. It is expected to be a replacement for JDBM (The current backend for the <strong>Apache Directory Server</strong>), but could be a good fit for any other project in need of a Java MVCC BTree implementation.
This milestone contains two different BTrees :</p>
<ul>
<li>one for in-memory BTrees</li>
<li>one for managed BTrees</li>
</ul>
<p>The rational for this big modification is that we can&rsquo;t easily have one BTree to gather all the characteristics of both the in-memory and the managed BTrees with oe single class.</p>
<p>We also have rewrote the way we handle added elements when we reach the end of the memory : we now use a cache instead of depending on wekReferences, which proved to be just way too slow.</p>
<p>The next milestones will add the missing features :</p>
<ul>
<li>bulk load support</li>
<li>multi-version support with free pages management</li>
<li>transaction support</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>ApacheDS</strong> has already been tested with <strong>Mavibot 1.0.-M2-SNAPSHOT</strong>, and it offers performances twice better than JDBM.</p>

<h2 class="news">Apache Mavibot 1.0.0-M1 released <em>posted on August 6th, 2013</em></h2>
<p>The Apache Directory team is pleased to announce the release of Apache Mavibot 1.0.0-M1, the first milestone towards a 1.0 version.</p>
<p><strong>Mavibot</strong> is a Multi Version Concurrency Control (MVCC) BTree in Java. It is expected to be a replacement for JDBM (The current backend for the <strong>Apache Directory Server</strong>), but could be a good fit for any other project in need of a Java MVCC BTree implementation.</p>
<p>This milestone is the first step toward a complete MVCC implementation, it currently does not handle versions at all. Anyway, it&rsquo;s already a in memory/On disk full BTree implementation, which is 2 to 3 times faster than JDBM.</p>
<p>The next milestones will add the missing features :</p>
<ul>
<li>bulk load support</li>
<li>multi-version support with free pages management</li>
<li>transaction support</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>ApacheDS</strong> has already been tested with <strong>Mavibot 1.0.-M1-SNAPSHOT</strong>, and it offers pretty good performances compared to JDBM, except when we inject a lot of entries in the server.</p>

<h2 class="news">Apache Mavibot added to Apache Directory project <em>posted on August 6th, 2013</em></h2>
<p>We are proud to announce that after less than one year of development in Apache Directory Labs, the Mavibot project has been accepted as a Apache Directory subproject.</p>
<p>The project is still in its infancy, and anyone willing to participate in the effort is very welcome !</p>
