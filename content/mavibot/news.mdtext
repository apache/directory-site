<h2 class="news">Apache Mavibot 1.0.0-M1 released <em>posted on August 6th, 2013</em></h2>

The Apache Directory team is pleased to announce the release of Apache Mavibot 1.0.0-M1, the first milestone towards a 1.0 version.

**Mavibot** is a Multi Version Concurrency Control (MVCC) BTree in Java. It is expected to be a replacement for JDBM (The current backend for the Apache Directory Server), but could be a good fit for any other project in need of a Java MVCC BTree implementation.

This milestone is the first step toward a complete MVCC implementation, it currently does not handle versions at all. Anyway, it's already a in memory/On disk full BTree implementation, which is 2 to 3 times faster than JDBM.

The next milestones will add the missing features :
- bulk load support
- multi-version support with free pages management
- transaction support

ApacheDS has already been tested with Mavibot 1.0.-M1-SNAPSHOT, and it offers pretty good performances compared to JDBM, except when we inject a lot of entries in the server.
