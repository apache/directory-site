## Apache Mavibot added to Apache Directory project _posted on August 6th, 2013_

We are pround to announce that after less than one year of development in Apache Directory Labs, the Mavibot project has been accepted as a Apache Directory subproject.

Mavibot is a **MVCC BTree** in Java. It is expected to be a replacement for **JDBM** we are using at _Directory_, but can fits any other project in the need of a Java _MVCC BTree_ implementation.

The project is still in its infancy, and anyone willing to participate in the effort is very welcome !
