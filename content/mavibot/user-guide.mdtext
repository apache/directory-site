**Work in progress**

This documentation is about the Mavibot projct developped at the Apache Software Foundation. We expect this project will be a replacement for **JDBM** we are currently using in Apache Directory Server, but also to be a reliable **MVCC BTree** implemntation that can be used by many other projects.

## About this guide

Getting started. Learn how to use Mavibot.

### Audience

This guide is primarily for people new to Mavibot. Only basic tasks are covered. Learn more about the options you have (and many other things) in the [Advanced User's Guide].

### Feedback welcome!

We are quite interested to improve the content of this guide. Feel free to provide us feedback:
