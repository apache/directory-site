# Issue Tracking

Our project uses [JIRA](http://www.atlassian.com/software/jira), a Java EE based issue tracking and project management application.

![JIRA](images/jira-space-logo.gif)

Issues, bugs, and feature requests should be submitted to the following issue tracking system.

<DIV class="note" markdown="1">
	As a general advice, server bugs must be added into DIRSERVER, not DIR.
	The DIR token should be used for general problems like documentation errors, and general problems not related to the server itself.
	Following this advice will help us a lot to improve bug tracking and resolution :-)
